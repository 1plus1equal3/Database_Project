This is not a good screening test but a positive result is highly specific. The best investigation would be cystoscopy & biopsy. Investigations for bladder cancer 1. Urinary cytology - Exfoliated cells from both normal and neoplastic urothelium can be readily identified in voided urine. Examination of cytological specimens can detect the malignant cells either at the time of initial presentation or during follow-up. Cytological examination may be especially useful in screening high-risk population and assessing the response to treatment. 2. Cystourethroscopy and tumor resection - The diagnosis and initial staging of bladder cancer is made by cystoscopy and transurethral resection. 3.Imaging (IVP, CT, MRI) - Although various imaging techniques can detect bladder cancer, its presence is confirmed by cystoscopy & biopsy. - Therefore imaging modalities are used to image the upper urinary tract and, when infiltrating bladder tumors are detected to assess the depth of muscle wall infiltration and the presence of local & distant metastasis. - Intravenous urography remains one of the most common imaging tests for the evaluation of hematuria. However, intravenous pyelography is increasingly being replaced by computed tomography (CT) urography, which is more accurate, for evaluation of the entire abdominal cavity, renal parenchyma, and ureters in patients with hematuria. Bladder tumors may be recognized as pedunculated, radiolucent filling defects projecting into the lumen; nonpapillary, infiltrating tumors may result in fixation or flattening of the bladder wall. 4. Urinary tumor markers - - Several new tests have been developed in order to overcome the shocomings of urinary cytology such as the low sensitivity for low-grade superficial tumors and inter-observer variability. - Commercially available tests include, the BTA test, the BTA stat test, the BTA TRAK assay determination of urinary nuclear matrix protein (NMP22), Immunocyt and UroVysion . - These tests can detect cancer specific proteins in urine (BTA\/NMP22) or augment cytology by identifying cell surface or cytogenetic markers in the nucleus. Other tests under investigation include identification of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated urothelial cells, and the determination of telomerase activity in exfoliated cells. - These tests have been demonstrated to enhance detection of bladder cancer when used either individually or in combination with cytology. They have been used to detect both new index tumors as well as recurrent tumors.",

According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the aerial wall initiated by injury to endothelium. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis: Endothelial injury Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis. After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium. TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. Migration of leukocytes When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells - formation of earliest lesion, i.e. fatty streak. Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL). Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-ct and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. Maturation of plaque Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collegen) and conve a fatty streak into a mature fibrofatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",

Rupture of the overlying fibrous cap, or of the thin-walled vessels in the areas of neovascularization, can cause intra-plaque hemorrhage; a contained hematoma may expand the plaque or induce plaque rupture.* Atheroembolism. Plaque rupture can discharge atherosclerotic debris into the bloodstream, producing microemboli* Alienism formation.

    "question": "Which of the following is not a component of transpo system?",
    "exp": "Functions: Transpo Systems An essential role of biomembranes is to allow movement of all compounds necessary for the normal function of a cell across the membrane barrier. These compounds include a vast array of substances like sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, steroids, cations and anions to mention a few. These compounds must enter or leave the cells in an orderly manner for normal functioning of the cell. A. 1. Ion Channels Ion channels are transmembrane channels, pore-like structures composed of proteins. Specific channels for Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl- have been identified. Cation conductive channels are negatively charged within the channel and have an average diameter of about 5 to 8 nm. All ion channels are basically made up of transmembrane subunits that come together to form a central pore through which ions pass selectively. All channels have gates and are controlled by opening and closing. Types of Gates Two types of gated channels. They are a. Ligand-gated channels: In this, a specific molecule binds to a receptor and opens the channel. Example: Acetylcholine receptor is present in the postsynaptic membrane. It is a complex of five subunits, having a binding site for acetylcholine. Acetylcholine released from the presynaptic region binds with the binding site of the postsynaptic region, which triggers the opening of the channel and influx of Na+. b. Voltage-gated channels: These channels open or close in response to changes in membrane potential. Some propeies of ion channels * Composed of transmembrane protein subunits. * Highly selective. * Well regulated by the presence of \"gates\". * Two main types of gates: Ligand-gated and voltage-gated. * Activities are affected by ceain drugs. * Mutations of genes encoding transmembrane proteins can cause specific diseases. 2. Ionophores Ceain microorganisms can synthesize small organic molecules, called ionophores, which function as shuttles for the movement of ions across the membrane. Structure: These ionophores contain hydrophilic centres that bind specific ions and are surrounded by peripheral hydrophobic regions. Types: Two types: (a) Mobile ion carriers: Like valinomycin (Refer uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation). (b) Channel formers: Like gramicidin. 3. Water Channels (Aquaporins) In ceain cells, e.g. in red blood cells, and cells of the collecting ductules of the kidney, the movement of water by simple diffusion is enhanced by movements of water through water channels, composed of tetrameric transmembrane proteins called aquaporins. About five distinct types of aquaporins have been recognised. CLINICAL ASPECT Recently mutations in the gene encoding AP-2 (Aquaporin 2) protein, have been shown to be the cause of one type of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. 4. Gap Junction Ceain cells develop specialized regions on their membranes for intercellular communications which are in close proximity. Function: They mediate and regulate the passage of ions and small molecules upto 1000 to 2000 mol wt, through a narrow hydrophilic core connecting the cytosol of adjacent cells. Structure: They are primarily composed of protein, called connexon which contains four membrane-spanning a-helices. the mitochondrial membrane also has paicularly energy coupling mechanism.Ref: MN Chatterjea Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, 8th edition",

    "exp": "Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

    "exp": "Ref:Robbins Basic Pathology (9th Edition),page no.478,479 Sarcoidosis Although sarcoidosis is considered here as an example of a restrictive lung disease, it is impoant to note that sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomas in many tissues and organs. MORPHOLOGY The diagnostic histopathologic feature of sarcoidosis is the noncaseating epithelioid granuloma, irrespective of the organ involved. This is a discrete, compact collection of epithelioid cells rimmed by an outer zone of largely CD4+ T cells. The epithelioid cells are derived from macrophages and are characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei. It is not uncommon to see intermixed multinucleate giant cells formed by fusion of macrophages. A thin layer of laminated fibroblasts is present peripheral to the granuloma; over time, these proliferate and lay down collagen that replaces the entire granuloma with a hyalinized scar. Two other microscopic features are sometimes seen in the granulomas: (1) Schaumann bodies, laminated concretions composed of calcium and proteins; and (2) asteroid bodies, stellate inclusions enclosed within giant cells. Their presence is not required for diagnosis of sarcoidosis--they also may occur in granulomas of other origins. Rarely, foci of central necrosis may be present in sarcoid granulomas, suggesting an infectious process. Caseation necrosis typical of tuberculosis is absent The lungs are involved at some stage of the disease in 90% of patients. The granulomas predominantly involve the interstitium rather than air spaces, with some tendency to localize in the connective tissue around bronchioles and pulmonary venules and in the pleura (\"lymphangitic\" distribution). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains abundant CD4+ T cells. In 5% to 15% of patients, the granulomas eventually are replaced by diffuse interstitial fibrosis, resulting in a so-called honeycomb lung. Intrathoracic hilar and paratracheal lymph nodes are enlarged and calcification in 75% to 90% of patients, while a third present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. The nodes are characteristically painless and have a firm, rubbery texture. Unlike in tuberculosis, lymph nodes in sarcoidosis are \"nonmatted\" (nonadherent) and do not ulcerate.",

A small amount of reverse T3 (rT3) is also formed.In the normal thyroid, the average distribution of iodinated compounds is 23% MIT, 33% DIT, 35% T4, 7% T3, and 2% reverse T3.",

Can be diagnosed intrauterineExplanationClinical features of ARPKD (Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease) are:Classic ARPKD is generally diagnosed in utero or within the neonatal period and characterized by greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys in diseased fetuses. (Option a)Reduced fetal urine production may contribute to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.About 30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life.In the classic group, most patients are bom with renal insufficiency and ESRD (End stage renal disease). (Option b)However, infants often have a transient improvement in their GFR; death from renal insufficiency at this stage is rare.Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage and form the older group. Morbidity and mortality in this group often involve systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations.The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli's disease). CHF and Caroli's disease can then lead to portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis.Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD (Option c and e) and markedly atrophic kidneys following renal transplantation.The slow progression of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the development of cysts.Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD patients, even those with normal renal function.

    "exp": "Gastritis is a nonspecific term that describes any inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Acute gastritis refers to the clinical situation of gastric mucosal erosions (not mucosal ulcers). Acute gastritis is also known as hemorrhagic gastritis or acute erosive gastritis. Acute gastritis is associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and coicosteroids, and also with alcohol, chemotherapy, ischemia, shock, and even severe stress. Two types of stress ulcers are Curling's ulcers, seen in patients with severe burns, and Cushing's ulcers, seen in patients with intracranial lesions. Grossly acute gastritis appears as multiple, scattered, punctate (less than 1 cm) hemorrhagic areas in the gastric mucosa. This is helpful in differentiating acute gastritis from peptic ulcers, which tend to be solitary and larger. Microscopically the gastric mucosa from a patient with acute gastritis is likely to reveal mucosal erosions, scattered neutrophils, edema, and possibly hemorrhage. Acute gastritis. Erosion and complete effacement of the epithelium is observed. The residual glands, on the left, display regenerative changes with basophilic epithelium.

A: Ankylosing Spondylitis The basic pathologic lesion of ankylosing spondylitis occurs at the entheses, which are sites of attachment to bone of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules. Enthesopathy results from inflammation, with subsequent calcification and ossification at and around the entheses. Inflammation with cellular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with erosion and eburnation of the subligamentous bone. The process usually stas at the sacroiliac joints. Other enthesopathic sites include the iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, patella, and calcaneum. Ankylosing spondylitis\/ AS\/ Bechterew's disease\/ Bechterew syndrome\/ Marie Strumpell disease\/Spondyloahritis is a chronic, painful, degenerative inflammatory ahritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine. AS is a systemic rheumatic disease and one of the seronegative spondyloahropathies. About 90% of the patients express the HLA-B27 genotype. Men are affected more than women by a ratio in excess of 10:1. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. Complete fusion results in a complete rigidity of the spine, a condition known as bamboo spine. In 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with iridocyclitis causing eye pain and photophobia. 4.1 AS is also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and Reiter's disease Other complications are aoic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block and amyloidosis & restrictive lung disease. A clinical examination and X-ray studies of the spine, which show characteristic spinal changes and sacroiliitis, are the major diagnostic tools. The Schober's test is a useful clinical measure of flexion of the lumbar spine performed during examination.",

    "question": "The number of ATPs generated in krebs cycleare ?",
    "exp": "Ans. is 'b' > b' i.e., 24 One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12.5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle.Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :- Method ofNo of ATPsNo of ATPsPathwayStepEnzymeSource ATP formationgained perglucose(new calculation)As per oldcalculationGlycolysis1Hexokinase MinusMinus 1Do3Phosphofructokinase MinusMinus 1Do5Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5 x 2 = 53 x 2 = 6Do61,3-BPGkinase ATPSubstrate level1 x 2 -- 21 x 2 = 2Do9Pyruvate kinaseATP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Pyruvate to?PyruvateNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase TCA cycle3Isocitrate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Do4Alpha keto glutarate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Do5Succinate thiokinaseGTP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Do6Succicinate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1.5x2= 32 x 2= 4Do8Malate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway 9 minus 2= 7 10 minus 2= 8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction 5 * 6Generation in citric acid cycle 20 * 24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole 32 * 38",

Teeth erupt normally with no obvious abnormality but rapidly develop mobility resulting from limited root support. In type II, the deciduous teeth are similar to those in dentinogenesis imperfecta, whereas the permanent teeth appear normal.\nRadiological signs\nIn Type I, all the teeth, except the canines, have extremely short roots. The roots are conical or blunted. There is pulpal obliteration and the inferior aspects of the crown exhibit linear crescent-shaped radiolucent lines. Periapical radiolucencies are commonly seen associated with non-carious teeth in Type I dentinal dysplasia. In Type II dentinal dysplasia, obliteration of the pulp occurs post eruption in the deciduous dentition. In the permanent dentition, there is alteration in the configuration of the pulp resulting in enlarged pulp chambers extending well down into the root.

    "question": "Most serious complication seen in other eye after traumatic injury to one eye: March 2005, September 2008",
    "exp": "Ans. C: Sympathetic ophthalmia Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a condition in which serious inflammation attacks the sound eye after injury (including intraocular surgeries) to the other. It is the most dreaded complication of unilateral severe eye injury, as it can leave the patient completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. Sympathetic ophthalmia is thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. It is thought that Louis Braille, who injured his left eye as a child, lost vision in his right eye due to SO Floating spots and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe iridocyclitis with pain and photophobia. Commonly the eye remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea. The retina, however, usually remains uninvolved. Papilledema, secondary glaucoma, vitiligo and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO. Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An impoant differential diagnosis is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury. Definitive prevention of SO requires prompt (within the first 7 to 10 days following injury) enucleation of the injured eye. Evisceration--the removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact--is easier to perform, offers long-term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing. But evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation. Immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for SO. When initiated promptly following injury, it is effective in controlling the inflammation and improving the prognosis.",

Generally, no treatment other than reassurance is required in most of these patients. Also known as Crocodile tears (gustatory lacrimation): There is unilateral lacrimation with mastication.

Rapid correction should be avoided so as not to cause central pontine myelinolysis, manifested by neurologic symptoms ranging from seizures to brain damage and death. Additionally, a search for the underlying etiology of the hyponatremia should be undeaken. Acute severe hyponatremia sometimes occurs following elective surgical procedures due to a combination of appropriate stimulation of antidiuretic hormone and injudicious administration of excess free water in the first few postoperative days. Other potential etiologies include hyperosmolarity with free-water shifts from the intra- to the extracellular compament (eg, hyperglycemia), sodium depletion (eg, gastrointestinal or renal losses, insufficient intake), dilution (eg, drug-induced), and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).",

Patients are also susceptible to infection with intracellular bacteria, because of defective T cell-mediated immunity. B cells and serum immunoglobulins are generally unaffected. The disorder is a consequence of a developmental mal- formation affecting the third and fouh pharyngeal pouches, structures that give rise to the thymus, parathy- roid glands, and poions of the face and aoic arch. Thus, in addition to the thymic and T cell defects, there may be parathyroid gland hypoplasia, resulting in hypocalce- mic tetany, as well as additional midline developmental abnormalities. In 90% of cases of DiGeorge syndrome there is a deletion affecting chromosomal region 22q11, as discussed in Chapter 6.

    "exp": "Ans. D: Caecum Adult Enterobius vermicularis worms inhabit the caecum, appendix and adjacent poions of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface. Pinworm (genus En terobius)\/Threadworm\/Seatworm, It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common human intestinal parasite, especially in children. It inhabits the caecum, appendix and adjacent poion of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface It causes enterobiasis, or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae. The pinworm appears as a white, small and delicate nematode. The adult female has a sharply pointed posterior end, is 8 to 13 millimeters long, and 0.5 millimeter thick. The adult male is considerably smaller, measuring 2 to 5 millimeters long and 0.2 millimeter thick, and has a curved posterior end. The eggs are translucent and have a surface that adheres to environmental objects. The eggs measure 50 to 60 micrometers by 20 to 30 micrometers, and have a thick shell that is flattened on one side. The small size and colorlessness of the eggs make them invisible to the naked eye, except in barely visible clumps of thousands of eggs. Eggs may contain a developing embryo or a fully developed pinworm larva.Inside the host, the larvae grow to 140-150 micrometers in length Pinworms spread through human-to-human transmission, by ingesting (i.e., swallowing) infectious pinworm eggs and\/or by anal sex. The eggs are hardy and can remain ble (i.e., infectious) in a moist environment for up to three weeks.They do not tolerate heat well, but can survive in low temperatures: two-thirds of the eggs are still ble after 18 hours at -8 degrees Celsius (18 degF). After the eggs have been initially deposited near the anus, they are readily transmitted to other surfaces through contamination. The surface of the eggs is sticky when laid, and the eggs are readily transmitted from their initial deposit near the anus to fingernails, hands, night-clothing and bed linen.From here, eggs are fuher transmitted to food, water, furniture, toys, bathroom fixtures and other objects.Household pets often carry the eggs in their fur, while not actually being infected. Dust containing eggs can become airborne and widely dispersed when dislodged from surfaces, for instance when shaking out bed clothes and linen.Consequently the eggs can enter the mouth and nose through inhalation, and be swallowed later. Although pinworms do not strictly multiply inside the body of their human host, some of the pinworm larvae may hatch on the anal mucosa, and migrate up the bowel and back into the gastrointestinal tract of the original host. This process is called retroinfection. Despite the limited, 13 week lifespan of individual pinworms, autoinfection (i.e., infection from the original host to itself), either through the anus-to-mouth route or through retroinfection, causes the pinworms to inhabit the same host indefinitely",

Loss of schooling and social contact, as well as frequent hospitalisation, can have impoant psychosocial consequences.Treatment is similar to that described for adults and may require glucocoicoids, immunosuppressive drugs, biological agents and surgery. Monitoring of height, weight and sexual development is crucial. Children with IBD should be managed by specialised paediatric gastroenterologists and transitioned to adult care in dedicated clinics . Pregnancy A women's ability to become pregnant is adversely affected by active IBD. Pre-conceptual counselling should focus on optimising disease control. During pregnancy, the rule of thirds applies: roughly one-third of women improve, one-third get worse and one-third remain stable with active disease. In the post-paum period, these changes sometimes reverse spontaneously. Drug therapy, including aminosalicylates, glucocoicoids Delayed growth and pubeal development: chronic active inflammation, malabsorption, malnutrition and long-term glucocoicoids contribute to sho stature and delayed development, with physical and psychological consequences. * Metabolic bone disease: more common with chronic disease beginning in childhood, resulting from chronic inflammation, dietary deficiency and malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D. * Drug side-effects and adherence issues: young people are more likely to require azathioprine or biological therapy than adults. Poor adherence to therapy is more common than with adults, as younger patients may feel well, lack self-motivation to adhere and believe that drugs are ineffective or cause side-effects. * Loss of time from education: physical illness, surgery, fatigue in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, privacy and dignity issues, and social isolation may all contribute. * Emotional difficulties: may result from challenges in coping with illness, problems with forming interpersonal relationships, and issues relating to body image or sexual function.

    "exp": "The synthesis and storage of thyroid hormones occurs between the follicular cells and the colloid. The storage form of thyroid hormone is thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is a large glycoprotein synthesized in the follicular cells and has a molecular weight of around 650 000 with about 140 tyrosine residues, depending on the form of thyroglobulin. Approximately one quaer of these residues is iodinated at the apical-colloid interface. Once iodinated, thyroglobulin is taken up into the colloid of the follicle where, still incorporated in the protein, a coupling reaction between pairs of iodinated tyrosine molecules occurs. The coupling of two tyrosine residues each iodinated at two positions (di-iodotyrosine, DIT) produces tetra-iodothyronine or thyroxine (T4 ) whilst the combination of DIT with mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) produces tri-iodothyronine (T3 ). Such coupling can occur within a single molecule of thyroglobulin or between dimerized molecules of the protein. This coupling is catalyzed by TPO. Thyroid hormones are stored in this state and are only released when the thyroglobulin molecule is taken back up into the follicular cells. Stimulated by TSH, thyroglobulin droplets are captured by the follicular cells by a process of pinocytosis. Fusion of the droplets with lysosomes results in hydrolysis of the thyroglobulin molecules and release of T3 and T4. Reference : page 2285 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 19th edition",

    "question": "MHC restriction is a pa of all except aEUR'",
    "exp": "Autoimmune disorder Major histocompatibility complex : Major histocompatibility complex, also called the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a 4 megahase region on chromosome 6. This region is densely packed with genes. These genes encodes two major proteins or antigens i.e., MHC I & MHC II. These proteins play an impoant role in the differentiation of foreign cells from host cell. Presence of these proteins is necessary for identification of host cells. Identification of the cells is impoant for immune responses. If the cell is recognised as self, the immune system will not mount an immune response against it. How does MHC helps in this ??? Cells continuously display small pieces of their own internal protein, carrying them, outsie the cell membrane where the immune system can see them. These peptides are just pieces of the normal proteins found inside the cell. These peptides are held together at the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex, which holds these peptides together for the immune system to examine them. Each persons immune system is customized early in life to ignore these peptides, so healthy cells are not able to trigger the immune system and they are left alone. But if any virus or other microorganism is multiplying inside the cell, the peptides synthesized by it also is displayed on the surface. The MHC displays these unusual (foreign) protein on the surface of the cell. The immune system is triggered because of these peptides, staing, a series of event that will eventually lead to killing of the cell containing foreign peptide. MHC is also the cause of tissue rejection during skin grafts and organ grafts. This is how the MHC protein got its name; the term histocompatibility refers to the difficulty of finding compatible grafts between a donor and a patient. Each person has their own collection of MHC molecules. If you graft a piece of skin that has a different collection of MHC types they will trigger the immune system to destroy the cell. So a compatible donor is needed such as a relative who has a similar collection of MHC molecules. MHC is also active against cancer Cancer cells, like normal cells, display pieces of their own protein on their surface. So if any of these proteins carries recognizable cancer mutations, this provides a signal to the immune system that something is wrong and the cell is killed. MHC plays role in activation of T helper cells (Th) MHC class II molecules are present on the membranes of dendritic cells, macrophages. These cell function as antigen presenting cell during immune response. They capture the antigen and present it to T helper cells. In response, the T helper cells secrete cytokines that stimulate B cell proliferation and antibody production. The impoant point about T helper cells is that they respond to only those antigens which have been presented to them by cells that have host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell. In general the antigen presenting cell .first phagocytoses the protein antigen and cleaves it to peptides in the lysosomes. These peptides are then extruded and attached to the presenting cell's surface MHC complex. T helper cells first, make sure, that these MHC class II molecules are host's own MHC and then responds appropriately. So, we can say that receptor on the T helper cell is thus responsive to the combination of antigen and host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell.

However, the use of these tools to cardiac imaging is severely limited because of motion aifacts produced by constantly in motion hea completing an entire cycle of contraction and relaxation in about 1 second.- So radiological cardiac imaging requires a 'window' of minimum cardiac motion to reduce motion aifacts and achieve meaningful images. The phase of minimum cardiac motion is although variable and depends on several factors especially hea rate and the chamber (i.e. right \/left - atrium or ventricle) to be specifically imaged.

On physical examination, blood pressure is 90\/60 mm Hg and pulse is 110 beats per minute and regular; the abdomen is soft with mild generalized tenderness and distention. Bowel sounds are hypoactive; stool Hematest is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management?",
    "exp": "In the absence of peritoneal signs, angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for acute mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed. The majority of affected patients are at high operative risk, but early diagnosis followed by revascularization or resectional surgery or both are the only hope for survival. Celiotomy must be performed once the diagnosis of aerial occlusion or bowel infarction has been made. Initial treatment of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia includes measures to increase cardiac output and blood pressure. Laparotomy should be performed if peritoneal signs develop",

It is about 10% of total activity and is increased in obstructive jaundice and to some extent in metastatic carcinoma of liver.# Alpha-2 heat labile ALP is stable at 56degC; but loses its activity when kept at 65degC for 30 minutes. It is produced by hepatic cells. Therefore, exaggerated alpha-2 band suggests hepatitis. This liver iso-enzyme forms about 25% of total ALP.# Alpha-2 heat stable ALP will not be destroyed at 65degC, but is inhibited by phenylalanine. It is of placental origin, which is found in blood in normal pregnancy. An iso-enzyme closely resembling the placental form is characteristically seen in circulation in about 15% cases of carcinoma of lung, liver and gut and named as Regan iso-enzyme (after the first patient in whom it was detected) or carcinoplacental iso-enzyme. Chronic heavy smoking also increases Regan iso-enzyme level in blood. Normal level is only 1% of the total ALP.# Pre-beta ALP is of bone origin and elevated levels are seen in bone diseases. This is most heat labile (destroyed at 56degC, 10 min). Wheat germ lectin will precipitate bone isoenzyme. This constitutes about 50% of normal ALP activity.# Gamma-ALP is inhibited by phenylalanine and originates from intestinal cells. It is increased in ulcerative colitis. About 10% of plasma ALP are of intestinal variety.# Leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is significantly decreased in chronic myeloid leukemia. It is increased in lymphomas and leukemoid reactions.ALANINE AMINO TRANSFERASE (ALT)# It is also called as serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT).# The enzyme needs pyridoxal phosphate as co-enzyme.# Normal serum level of AL T for male is 13^4-0 U\/L and for female is 10-28 U\/L.# Very high values (100 to 1000 U\/L) are seen in acute hepatitis, either toxic or viral in origin.# Both ALT and AST levels are increased in liver disease, but ALT > AST.# Moderate increase (25 to 100 U\/L) may be seen in chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, Hepatoma.# A sudden fall in ALT level in cases of hepatitis is very bad prognostic sign.NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHATASE# It is also known as 5' nucleotidase.# It is a marker enzyme for plasma membranes and is seen as an ecto-enzyme (enzyme present on the cell membrane).# Serum samples contain both ALP and NTP.# These are distinguished by Nickel ions which inhibit NTP but not ALP.- Normal NTP level in serum is 2-10 IU\/L.

Each episode, called an apnea, lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed, and such episodes occur repeatedly throughout sleep.> The standard definition of any apneic event includes a minimum 10 second interval between breaths, with either a neurological arousal (a 3-second or greater shift in EEG frequency, measured at C3, C4, O1, or O2), a blood oxygen desaturation of 3-4deg\/: or greater, or both arousal and desaturation. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or a \"Sleep Study\".> Treatment: The most common treatment and arguably the most consistently effective treatment for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, which 'splints' the patient's airway open during sleep by means of a flow of pressurized air into the throat. However the CPAP machine only assists inhaling whereas a BiPAP machine assists with both inhaling and exhaling, and is used in more severe cases.

It also binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak anti-glucocorticoid relative to mifepristone, and has no relevant affinity to the estrogen, androgen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium.Medical Uses* Emergency contraception: For emergency contraception, a 30mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after an unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 60% of expected, pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel.* Treatment of uterine fibroids: Ulipristal acetate is used for preoperative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age in a daily dose of a 5mg tablet. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids.InteractionsUlipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir. Therefore, concomitant use with these agents is not recommended. It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids.Adverse EffectsCommon side effects include abdominal pain and temporary menstrual irregularity or disruption. Headache and nausea were observed under long-term administration (12 weeks), but not after a single dose.ContraindicationsUlipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP-mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18.Pregnancy: Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies. Before taking the drug, a pregnancy must be excluded.",

    "exp": "Hepatitis C This is caused by an RNA flavivirus. Acute symptomatic infection with hepatitis C is rare. Most individuals are unaware of when they became infected and are identified only when they develop chronic liver disease. Eighty per cent of individuals exposed to the virus become chronically infected and late spontaneous viral clearance is rare. There is no active or passive protection against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C infection is usually identified in asymptomatic individuals screened because they have risk factors for infection, such as previous injecting drug use , or have incidentally been found to have abnormal liver blood tests. Although most people remain asymptomatic until progression to cirrhosis occurs, fatigue can complicate chronic infection and is unrelated to the degree of liver damage. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of what used to be known as 'non-A, non-B hepatitis'. If hepatitis C infection is left untreated, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs over 20-40 years. Risk factors for progression include male gender, immunosuppression (such as co-infection with HIV), prothrombotic states and heavy alcohol misuse. Not everyone with hepatitis C infection will necessarily develop cirrhosis but approximately 20% do so within 20 years. Once cirrhosis has developed, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 95% and 81%, respectively. One-quaer of people with cirrhosis will develop complications within 10 years and, once complications such as ascites develop, the 5-year survival is around 50%. Once cirrhosis is present, 2-5% per year will develop primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg877",

    "exp": "Traditionally, dentists have relied upon a visual-tactile radiographic\u00a0 procedure\u00a0 for\u00a0 the detection\u00a0 of\u00a0 dental caries. This procedure involves the visual identification of demineralized\u00a0 areas\u00a0 (typically\u00a0 white\u00a0 spots)\u00a0 or\u00a0 suspicious pits or fissures and the use of the dental explorer to determine the\u00a0 presence of a\u00a0 loss of continuity\u00a0 or breaks in the enamel and to assess the softness or resilience of the enamel. Caries lesions located on interproximal tooth surfaces\u00a0 have\u00a0 generally\u00a0 been\u00a0 detected\u00a0 with\u00a0 the\u00a0 use\u00a0 of\u00a0 bitewing radiographs. These procedures have been used routinely in virtually every dental office in the United States for the past 50 years. Tactile probing with an explorer is no longer used for caries detection in most European countries, and this protocol has now been adopted by many U.S. dental schools. The primary concerns that led to the discontinuation of the probing procedure were as follows:\n1. The\u00a0 insertion\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 explorer\u00a0 into\u00a0 the\u00a0 suspected lesion inevitably disrupts the surface layer covering very early lesions, thereby eliminating the possibility for remineralization of the decalcified area;\u00a0\n2.

    "exp": "Symptoms not caused by either local or metastatic effects of tumors are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Bronchogenic carcinomas are associated with the development of many different types of paraneoplastic syndromes. These syndromes are usually associated with the secretion of ceain substances by the tumor cells. For example, ectopic secretion of ACTH may produce Cushing's syndrome, while ectopic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) may produce hyponatremia. Hypocalcemia may result from the production of calcitonin, while hypercalcemia may result from the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is a normal substance produced locally by many different types of tissue. PTHrP is distinct from parathyroid hormone (PTH) patients with this type of paraneoplastic syndrome have increased calcium levels and decreased PTH levels. As a result of decreased PTH production, all of the parathyroid glands in these patients are atrophic. Other tumors associated with the production of PTHrP include clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, endometrial adenocarcinomas, and transitional carcinomas of the urinary bladder. Lung cancers are also associated with multiple, migratory venous thromboses. This migratory thrombophlebitis is called Trousseau's sign and is more classically associated with carcinoma of the pancreas. Hyperophic osteoahropathy is a syndrome consisting of periosteal new bone formation with or without digital clubbing and joint effusion. It is most commonly found in association with lung carcinoma, but it also occurs with other types of pulmonary disease. Erythrocytosis is associated with increased erythropoietin levels and some tumors, paicularly renal cell carcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, and cerebellar hemangioblastomas. It is not paicularly associated with bronchogenic carcinomas. Reference: Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease, 9edition.",

Pathophysiology 1. Cross reactivity of host antistreptococcal antibodies to cardiac antigens 2. Microbe initiated autoimmune reactivity. Jones Criteria for Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever Major Criteria Carditis Pancarditis, seen in 50-60% of patients, develops within the first 2 weeks of rheumatic fever. Pericarditis is evidenced by presence of a pericardial rub, myocarditis by tachycardia, soft S1, presence of S3 and CCF and endocarditis by the presence of Carey-Coombs' murmur (mitral diastolic murmur). Ahritis (60-75%) Flitting and fleeting type of polyahritis involving large joints with no residual deformity is seen in 60-75% of patients and occurs early in rheumatic fever. Jaccod's ahritis: Ulnar detion of 4th and 5th finger with flexion at metacarpophalangeal joints is the only residual deformity seen in rheumatic polyahritis. Subcutaneous Nodules Non-tender nodules are seen over bony prominences like elbows, shin, occiput, spine in 3-5% of patients and occur 3-6 weeks after onset of rheumatic fever. Patients who have subcutaneous nodules almost always have carditis. Erythema Marginatum (< 5% and evanescent) Macular lesions with an erythematous rim and central clearing in a bathing suit distribution are seen in < 5% of patients and occur early in rheumatic fever. Chorea (Sydenham's Chorea) (2-30%) A neurological disorder with rapid, involuntary and purposeless non-repetitive movements with a self limiting course of 2-6 weeks is more common in females and is a late manifestation of rheumatic fever. Minor Criteria Clinical 1. Fever 2. Ahralgia 3. Previous history of rheumatic fever or rheumatic hea disease. Laboratory 1. Acute phase reactants (leucocytosis, raised ESR, C-reactive protein) 2. Prolonged PR interval in ECG (> 0.2 sec). WHO Criteria Jones major and pa of the minor criteria except prior history of rheumatic fever\/rheumatic hea disease and C-reactive protein. Essential Criteria Evidence for recent streptococcal infection as evidenced by: 1. Increase in ASO titre a. > 333 Todd units (in children) b. > 250 Todd units (in adults). 2. Positive throat culture for streptococcal infection. 3. Recent history of scarlet fever. Two major (or) one major and two minor criteria, in the presence of essential criteria, is required to diagnose Acute Rheumatic Fever. A Positive Rheumatic Fever history is usually elicited in only 50% of patient with Rheumatic Hea Disease. Valve Involvement in Rheumatic Hea Disease Mitral valve alone 50% Aoic valve alone 15-20% Mitral and Aoic valves together 35-40% Mitral, Aoic and Tricuspid valves 2-3% Pulmonary valve is viually never involved. In RHD, mitral valve is most commonly involved followed by involvement of the aoic valve as the pressure gradient across the mitral valve is the greatest, followed by that across the aoic valve.

    "exp": "Answer: (C) Thalassemia minor anemia may present with normal RBC diameter (265-68-Hrshmohon 7th) (630= Rabbins- basis disease)Red blood cell distribution width (RDW or RCDW) is a measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume that is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 pm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin Bl2 orfolate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two- thirds of all cases; however, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of a mixed iron and B!2 deficiency, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias; anemia of chronic disease,hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) all may present with a normal RDW* The human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7-2 pm in diameter, and has a thickness of 2-4 pm at the periphery and 1 mm in the centre* More than 90% of the weight of erythrocytes consists of haemoglobin.

    "question": "Signal from Baroreceptors goes to -",
    "exp": "Ans. is C Nucleus of tractus solitarius o Baroreceptors are mechanoreceptors that are located in the adventia of carotid artery and aorta, at specialized locations called sinuses. Carotid sinus is a little bulge at the root of internal carotid artery, located just above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. It is innerv ated by the sinus nerve, a branch of glossopharyngeal (IX cranial) nerve. Aortic arch (aortic sinus) also contains mechenoreceptors (stretch receptors) which are similar to carotid sinus receptors. However, their afferent nerve fibers travel in the aortic nerve, a branch of Vagus (X cranial) nerve. o The sinus nerve (from carotid sinus) and aortic nerve\/vagal fibers (from aortic sinus) are together called 'Sino- aortic nerves'. They, together, are also refered to as 'Buffer nerves' because they are the afferents of cardiovascular reflexes that buffer abrupt changes in blood pressure. o Baroreceptors are highly sensitive to any change in mean blood pressure. Sinoaortic nerves (buffer nerves) normally discharge rhythmically, synchronous with the pressure fluctuation during systole and diastole. They respond to BP changes between 70 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg. When BP rises, baroreceptors are stimulated and their afferents (through sinoaortic nerves) stimulate nucleus of tractus solitarus (NTS) which inturn inhibits the pressor area of VMC, i.e., Rostral ventrolateral medula (RVLM). This results in decreased sympathetic outflow and therefore decreases in vasomotor tone and vasodilation. Vasodilation brings down the BP. Thereby helping hemostasis. Activated NTS also stimulates nucleus ambiguous (cardioinhibitory center) of medulla, which increases parasympathetic (vagal) output, through vagus, that decreases heart rate. Reduction in heart rate reduces the cardiac output, which also reduces BP. Baroreceptor stimulation also weekly inhibits respiration, o When BP falls, for instance while changing the posture from lying down to standing, reverse change takes place. When a person stands up, his blood is pooled in the veins of lowrer limbs by the effect of gravity. Central venous pressure and venous return decrease, which causes a fall in stroke volume. Hence the systolic BP falls. As a result, the discharge rate of baroreceptors decreases leading to a decrease in the inhibitory' influence on the pressor area of VMC. Hence vasomotor tone increases, leading to vasoconstriction, and consequently an increase in BP. Simultaneously, the nucleus ambiguous of the vagus is also inhibited, increasing the heart rate and consequently stroke volume and eventually BP. Thus fall in BP due to change of posture is very brief (Transient).",

    "question": "Intrinsic factor of castle is secreted by which of the following cells in gastric glands",
    "exp": "The stomach also adds a significant volume of digestive juices to the meal. Like salivary secretion, the stomach actually readies itself to receive the meal before it is actually taken in, during the so-called cephalic phase that can be influenced by food preferences. The gastric secretions arise from glands in the wall of the stomach that drain into its lumen, and also from the surface cells that secrete primarily mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach from digesting itself, as well as substances known as trefoil peptides that stabilize the mucus-bicarbonate layer. The glandular secretions of the stomach differ in different regions of the organ. The most characteristic secretions derive from the glands in the fundus or body of the stomach. These contain two distinctive cell types from which the gastric secretions arise: the parietal cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; and the chief cells, which produce pepsinogens and gastric lipase. The acid secreted by parietal cells serves to sterilize the meal and also to begin the hydrolysis of dietary macromolecules. Intrinsic factor is impoant for the later absorption ofvitamin B12 or cobalamin. Pepsinogen is the precursor of pepsin, which initiates protein digestion. Lipase similarly begins the digestion of dietary fats.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:432",

In addition to having a powerful effect on the secretion of growth hormone, ghrelin stimulates energy production and signals directly to the hypothalamic regulatory nuclei that control energy homeostasis.

    "exp": "A i.e. Autosomal dominant (most likely) Waardenburg's Syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by pigmentary disturbances (skin, hair, iris), sensorineural hearing loss, and other developmental anomalies such as dystopia canthorum (widely spaced eyes) and blepharophimosis. The syndrome that closest matches the features provided in the question is Waardeburg syndrome type-I. This is inherited as an autosomal dominant fashion and hence is the answer of exclusion. As the question does not provide us with details as to the sex of the three children, a sex linked inheritance pattern cannot be worked out. Also the combined presentation of an affected father, unaffected mother and one affected child among three children is possible with both an autosomal dominant and an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In absence of any more details, the answer to this question cannot be deduced through the exploration of various permutations and combinations. How both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance can be responsible for the above combination: Autosomal Dominant Autosomal recessive (A-affected allele and a normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal Dominant then :Father (affected) will be either 'AA' or 'Aa' Mother (unaffected) will be 'aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% affected If father is Aa and mother aa, the offsprings will Aa - 50% affected aa - 50% not affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible autosomal dominant inheritance if father is Aa and mother is aa (A'-affected allele and 'a' normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal recessive form :Father (affected) will be 'AA' Mother (unaffected) may be 'aa' or 'Aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% not affected, (but carriers) If father is AA and mother Aa, the offsprings will be Aa - 50% not affected, carrier AA - 50% affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible with autosomal recessive inheritance if father is aa and mother is Aa",

Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol:The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload).Propofol markedly impairs the normal arterial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload.Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental)The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, bas line autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease.Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure.Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes.However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, b adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and arterial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression.Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular systemKetamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial work.Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms.",

Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.",

    "question": "A patient present with lower gastrointestinal bleed. Sigmoidoscopy shows ulcers inthe sigmoid. Biopsy from this area shows flask-shaped ulcers. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment -",
    "exp": "This may be caused by haemorrhage from the colon, anal canal or small bowel. It is useful to distinguish those patients who present with profuse, acute bleeding from those who present with chronic or subacute bleeding of lesser severity .Severe acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding .This presents with profuse red or maroon diarrhoea and with shock. Diveicular disease is the most common cause and is often due to erosion of an aery within the mouth of a diveiculum. Bleeding almost always stops spontaneously, but if it does not, the diseased segment of colon should be resected after confirmation of the site by angiography or colonoscopy. Angiodysplasia is a disease of the elderly, in which vascular malformations develop in the proximal colon. Bleeding can be acute and profuse; it usually stops spontaneously but commonly recurs. Diagnosis is often difficult. Colonoscopy may reveal characteristic vascular spots and, in the acute phase, visceral angiography can show bleeding into the intestinal lumen and an abnormal large, draining vein. In some patients, diagnosis is achieved only by laparotomy with on-table colonoscopy. The treatment of choice is endoscopic thermal ablation but resection of the affected bowel may be required if bleeding continues. Bowel ischaemia due to occlusion of the inferior mesenteric aery can present with abdominal colic and rectal bleeding. It should be considered in patients (paicularly the elderly) who have evidence of generalised atherosclerosis. The diagnosis is made at colonoscopy. Resection is required only in the presence of peritonitis. Meckel's diveiculum with ectopic gastric epithelium may ulcerate and erode into a major aery. The diagnosis should be considered in children or adolescents who present with profuse or recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. A Meckel's 99mTc-peechnetate scan is sometimes positive but the diagnosis is commonly made only by laparotomy, at which time the diveiculum is excised Primary prevention of variceal bleeding If non-bleeding varices are identified at endoscopy, b-adrenoceptor antagonist (b-blocker) therapy with propranolol (80-160 mg\/day) or nadolol (40-240 mg\/day) is effective in reducing poal venous pressure. Administration of these drugs at doses that reduce the hea rate by 25% has been shown to be effective in the primary prevention of variceal bleeding. In patients with cirrhosis, treatment with propranolol reduces variceal bleeding by 47% (number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) 10), death from bleeding by 45% (NNTB 25) and overall moality by 22% (NNTB 16). The efficacy of b-blockers in primary prevention is similar to that of prophylactic banding, which may also be considered, paicularly in patients who are unable to tolerate or adhere to b-blocker therapy. Carvedilol, a non-cardioselective vasodilating b-blocker, is also effective and may be better tolerated at doses of 6.25-12.5 mg\/day). For these, dose should be titrated, as tolerated, to achieve a hea rate of 50-55 beats\/min, if possible.metrandazole can be given sigmoidal ulcer Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 869",

Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates--up to 5 litres per minute (L\/min)--delivering an oxygen concentration of 28-44%. Rates above 5 L\/min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L\/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L\/min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a non-rebreather mask. It is especially useful in those patients where vasoconstriction could negatively impact their condition, such as those suffering from strokes.",

Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar veebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphates is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphates assay has been superseded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate-specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), neveheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. Normal serum level - less than 4 mg\/ml 4 - 10 mg\/ml - this range is common for both BHP and Ca. More than 10 mg\/ml - approx 75% will have cancer. Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density is used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 mg\/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 mg\/ml, per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level.

This allow time for DNA repair.b) DNA repair: p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage). GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair.* If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 - Relieve in cell cycle block. If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis inducing gene BAX. So p-53 prevents replication of cell with defective DNA - p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against formation of cancer.

Final (post-treatment) records and retainer impressions can be taken 2 or 3 weeks after the positioner is placed.

Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently. After the flow rate and profile are set the inflation time of machine is set and remains unresponsive to patients native cycling rythm and flow demands.

Xerophthalmia caused by a severe vitamin A deficiency is described by pathologic dryness of the conjunctiva and * cornea. The conjunctiva becomes dry, thick and wrinkled. If untreated, it can lead to corneal ulceration and ultimately to blindness as a result of corneal damage. Xerophthalmia is a term that usually implies a destructive dryness of the conjunctival epithelium due to dietary vitamin A deficiency -- a rare condition in developed countries, but still causing much damage in developing countries. Other forms of dry eye are associated with aging, poor lid closure, scarring from previous injury, or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid ahritis and SjOgren's syndrome, and these can all cause chronic conjunctivitis. Radioiodine therapy can also induce xerophthalmia, often transiently Xerophthalmia from hypovitaminosis A is specifically due to lack of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid Treatment can occur in two ways: treating symptoms and treating the deficiency. Treatment of symptoms usually includes use of aificial tears in the form of eye drops, increasing the humidity of the environment with humidifiers, and wearing wrap around glasses when outdoors. Treatment of the deficiency can be accomplished with a Vitamin A or multivitamin supplement or by eating foods rich in Vitamin A. Treatment with supplements and\/or diet can be successful until the disease progresses as far as corneal ulceration, at which point only an extreme surgery can offer a chance of returning sight.",

When I go and meet my girlfriend, she checks my messages and picks up fight (aversive response) suddenly I delete all messages one day and that day there was no fight (no aversive response) then that behavior is repeated (delete all messages before meeting my girlfriend) Extinction is the type of reinforcement where a behavior is done and a rewarding response is removed the chance is that behavior will not be repeated A child likes to play with children( reward) but when the child fights with other children( undesirable behavior) the child will be removed from playing( removing a reward) , then the child stops fighting with other children( reduction of undesirable behaviour) Ref. kaplon and sadock synopsis, 11 th edition, pg no. 845",

    "question": "Which is NOT used in treatment of heroin dependence?",
    "exp": "Ans. is 'a' i.e., Disulfiram o Heroin is diamorphine and is 3 times more potent than morphine.Treatment of morphine or heroin poisoningo Treatment can be divided into:-A. Treatment of toxicity (overdose)# Overdose is a medical emergency, and is treated with opioid antagonist to reverse the complications (respiratory depression) by antagonizing the action on opioid receptors. Intravenous naloxone is the antagonist of choince for morphine (heroin) poisoning. Oral naltrexone is used for maintenance therapy, once acute poisoning has been treated by iv naloxone. Intravenous nalmefene is another specific antagonist.B. Treatment of dependence# Treatment of dependence include medically supervised withdrawal and detoxification, followed by maintenance therapy.a) Detoxificationo Detoxification process include abrupt withdrawal of opioid followed by management of the emergent withdrawal symptoms, i.e., treatment of withdrawal syndrome. Detoxification can be done by any of the following.1. Substitution of long-acting opioid agonism:- Methadone is the treatment of choice. Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol\/ Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points).2. Substitution of partial agonist:- Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its partial agonistic activity on opioid receptor.3. Substitution by a2 agonists:- Clonidine acts as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine.4. Clonidine plus naltrexone:- A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of short acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help relieve withdrawl symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should be kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawl syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawl syndrome.5. Other drugs:- Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylateb) M aintenance therapyo Once detoxification phase is over (i.e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing 'kick' or 'euphoria' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are:-1. Methadone:- Reduces craving and 'kick\/euphoria' from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied.2. LAAM and buprenorphine:- Similarly reduce craving.3. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone):- Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of exopioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawl syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior - If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no 'kick' or 'euphoria' as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification.",

He states that he just returned from a convention, and had noticed increasing pain in his right foot during his flight back home. Physical examination is remarkable for swelling and erythema of the right great toe as well as small nodules on the patient's external ear. Aspiration of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the affected toe demonstrates needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?",
    "exp": "The patient has gout, which is due to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joint spaces (notably the great toe) and soft tissues (causing tophi, which are often found on the external ears). Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric agents, increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid, hence decreasing serum levels of the substance.

Thromboxane A2 (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12\/e p868; Katzung 12\/e p638; KDT 7\/e p195, 6\/e p186, 609)Aspirin causes several different effects in the body, mainly the reduction of inflammation, analgesia, the prevention of clotting, and the reduction of fever. Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2.\"In platelets, the major cyclooxygenase product is TxA2 (thromboxane A 2), a labile inducer of platelet aggregation and a potent vasoconstrictor. Aspirin blocks production of TxA2 by acetylating a serine residue near the active site of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), the enzyme that produces the cyclic endoperoxide precursor of TxA2. Because platelets do not synthesize new proteins, the action of aspirin on platelet COX-1 is permanent, lasting for the life of the platelet (7-10 days). Thus. repeated doses of aspirin produce a cumulative effect on platelet function. \"-- Goodman Gilman 12\/e p868Drugs affecting Thromboxane A2COX inhibitors like aspirin decreases the synthesis of TXA2QDaltroban & Sultroban are TXA2 receptor antagonistsQDazoxihen inhibits the enzyme thromboxane synthetaseQAspirinAspirin is now rarely used as an anti-inflammatory medication and used for its anti-platelet effectsQ (doses of 81-325 mg once daily).Mechanisms of Action:In platelets, the major cyclooxygenase product is TxA2, a labile inducer of platelet aggregation & a potent vasoconstrictorQ.Aspirin blocks production of TxA2 by acetylating a serine residue near active site of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), enzyme that produces cyclic endoperoxide precursor of TxA2Q.Because platelets do not synthesize new proteins, the action of aspirin on platelet COX-1 is permanent, lasting for the life of the platelet (7-10 days)Q.Clinical UsesAspirin decreases the incidence of transient ischemic attacks, unstable angina, coronary artery thrombosis with myocardial infarction & thrombosis after coronary artery bypass graftingQ.Epidemiologic studies suggest that long-term use of aspirin at low- dosage is associated with a lower Incidence of colon cancer, possibly- related to its COX-Inhibiting effectsQ.Adverse EffectsGastric upset (intolerance) and gastric & duodenal ulcersQ.Hepatotoxicity, asthma, rashes, GI bleeding & renal toxicity rarely if ever occur at antithrombotic doses.Antiplatelet action of aspirin contraindicates its use by patients with hemophiliaQ.",

    "exp": "Generation time of bacteria refers to the doubling time. Mycobacterium leprae is the slowest growing human bacterial pathogen, it has a doubling time of 14 days. It grows best at 30 degree C, at a temperature lower than body temperature, therefore it grows preferentially in the skin and superficial nerves. Mycobacterium leprae is transmitted by prolonged contact with patients with lepromatous leprosy, who discharge M. leprae in large numbers in nasal secretions and from skin lesions. 2 forms of leprosy are: Tuberculoid and Lepromatous. In tuberculoid type: CMI response to the organism limits its growth, very few acid-fast bacilli are seen, and granulomas containing giant cells form. In lepromatous leprosy: CMI response to organism is poor, the skin and mucous membrane lesions contain large numbers of organisms, foamy histiocytes rather than granulomas are found, and the lepromin skin test result is negative.

    "exp": "Ans. is 'd' i.e., Glycosyiution.m-RNA processingo Prokaryotic mRNA is functional immediately upon synthesis, i.e. prokaryotic primary transcript of mRNA is functional. Thus it does not require post-transcriptional modification. In Eukaryotes the primary transcript of mRNA is the hn RNA (hetrogeneous nuclear RNA). After transcription hnRNA is extensively modified to form functional mRNA. These modifications are as follows.The 51-cappingThis is the first processing reaction. 5l-end of mRNA is capped with 7-methylguansosine. This cap helps in initiation of translation (protein synthesis) and stabilizes the structure of mRNA by protecting from 5'-exonuclease.Addition of poly 'A' tail As the name suggests, multiple4A' (adenylate) residues are added at 31 end.This poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA. but rather added after transcription. These tails helps to stabilize the mRNA (by protecting from 31-exonuclease), facilitate exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After mRNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shortened. Some mRNAs do not have poly-A tail, e.g. mRNAs of histones and some interferons.Removal of introns (splicing) Eukaryotic genes contain some coding sequences which code for protein and some intervening non-coding sequences which do not code for protein. The coding sequences are called 'exons'and intervening non-coding sequences are called 'introns'. The process by which introns are excised and exons are linked to form functional mRNA is called splicing. Thus mature mRNA does not contain introns.# Spitcesome :- Splicesome is an assembly made up of small nuclear RNA (snRNA), some proteins and hnRNA. snRNA combines with proteins to form small nuclear ribnonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs or snurps) that mediate splicing. It is snRNA component of snurps that catalyzes splicing. Snurps are U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6-o Only about 1[?]5% of human DNA has coding sequence (exons). Remaining is non-coding (introns).Alternate splicing :- The hn-RNA molecules from some genes can be spliced in alternative way in different tissues. Thus two or more different mRNA (and therefore 2 or more proteins) can be synthesized from same hnRNA. For example, difference isoforms of tropomyosin in different tissues in due to alternate splicing.",

    "question": "Regarding glutathione which of the following is\/are true:",
    "exp": "Ans:C.)It helps in membrane transpo. GLUTATHIONE: Glutathione is a tripeptide made up of glutamate, cysteine and glycine (T-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine). Glutathione is present in all mammalian cells except neurons. The sulphydryl (-SH) group of cysteine residue is the reactive poion of glutathione which can undergo oxidation and reduction. Thus, glutathione may exist as the reduced (G-SH) or oxidized form (G-S-S-G) and can play a role in some oxidation-reduction reactions. In oxidized form two molecules of glutathione are linked by disulfide bond. Cysteine in glutathione act as reducing agent FUNCTIONS : - It helps in keeping some enzyme in active state by preventing the oxidation of sulphydryl (-SH) group of enzyme. It helps in detoxification of H2O2 by reducing it. Superoxide anion (O2) first conveed to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase. Glutathione helps in membrane transpo H2O2 is then reduced to H2O2 by glutathione perioxidase, a reaction requires reduced glutathione. Thus, glutathione scavenges free radicals and superoxide anion. It helps in detoxification of xenobiotics by their conjugation (conjugation reaction). Reduced form of glutathione (GSH) with a free sulphydryl (-SH) group serves as a redox buffer, regulating redox state of the cell. Reduced glutathione is essential for maintaining the normal structure of RBCs and for keeping hemoglobin iron in ferrous state (prevents formation of methemoglobin). It is involved in the transpo of amino acids across the cell membane of kidney and intestine.",

Like retinopathy, neuropathy occurs secondary to metabolic disturbance, and prevalence is related to the duration of diabetes and the degree of metabolic control. Pathological features can occur in any peripheral nerves. They include axonal degeneration of both myelinated and unmyelinated fibres, with thickening of the Schwann cell basal lamina, patchy segmental demyelination and abnormal intraneural capillaries (with basement membrane thickening and microthrombi).

Chronotropic drugs may change the hea rate by affecting the nerves controlling the hea, or by changing the rhythm produced by the sinoatrial node. Positive chronotropes increase hea rate; negative chronotropes decrease hea rate. A dromotrope affects Atrioventricular node (AV node) conduction. A positive dromotrope increases AV nodal conduction, and a negative dromotrope decreases AV nodal conduction. A lusitrope is an agent that affects diastolic relaxation. Inotropes affects contractility of the hea. Chronotropic variables in systolic myocardial performance can be split left and right. Left sided systolic chronotropy can be appreciated as Aoic Valve open to close time. Right sided variables are represented by Pulmonary valve open to close time. Inveed as diastolic chronotropy, the variables are aoic valve close to open and pulmonic close to open time.",

The NH3 mechanism is a valuable device for the conservation of fixed base. Under normal conditions, 30 to 50 mEq of H+ ions are eliminated per day, by combination with NH3 and about 10 to 30 mEq, as titratable acid, i.e. buffered with PO4. Ammonia Mechanism A third mechanism operates in the distal renal tubule cells, for the elimination of H+ ions and the conservation of Na+, by production of NH3 by the renal tubular epithelial cells. Source of NH3 in Distal Tubular Epithelial Cells 1. NH3 is produced by the hydrolysis of Glutamine by the enzyme Glutaminase which is present in these cells. 2. In addition to above, if the cells require NH3 more *NH3 can also be formed from other amino acids by oxidative deamination by L-amino acid oxidase. *NH3 can also be formed from glycine by glycineoxidase. The NH3 thus formed forms NH+4 ions by combining with H+ ions and NH+4 ions can exchange Na+ ion from NaCl. NH+4 ions formation *NH3 can diffuse into the tubular filtrate and there forms NH+4 ions in combination with H+ ions. *NH3 can combine with H+ ions inside the cells and then NH+4 ions come into tubular filtrate.

    "exp": "The plasma colloid osmotic pressure is often low in alcoholics with chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). The diseased liver cannot produce adequate amounts of albumin, which leads to a decrease in the concentration of albumin in the plasma, i.e., hypoalbuminemia. Because about 75% of the plasma colloid osmotic pressure can be attributed to the presence of albumin in the plasma, the decrease in plasma albumin concentration that occurs in the latter stages of cirrhosis often leads to peripheral edema. Cirrhosis also causes excess fluid to accumulate in the peritoneal cavity as ascites. In the case of ascites, the edema results not only from hypoalbuminemia, but also from poal vein obstruction (which increases capillary hydrostatic pressure) as well as the obstruction of lymphatic drainage of the liver. In fact, ascites is observed more often than peripheral edema in liver disease. A decrease in capillary hydrostatic pressure would tend to decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, and thereby oppose the development of edema. A decrease in the colloid osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid would decrease fluid loss from the capillaries, thereby opposing the development of edema. A decrease in interstitial hydrostatic pressure would tend to increase fluid loss from the capillaries, but this cannot be considered a primary cause of edema because the interstitial hydrostatic pressure actually increases when a tissue becomes edematous.

    "exp": "Ans is A (Maximum risk is within 1 year of splenectomy) Overwhelming Postsplenectomy Infection (OPSI) Splenectomised patients are likely to suffer from severe infections. This syndrome is called overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI). OPSI is among the more devastating sequelae of asplenia and is the most common fatal late complication of splenectomy. The loss of the spleen's ability to filter and phagocytose bacteria and parasitized blood cells predisposes the patient to infection by encapsulated bacteria or parasites. Splenectomy also results in the loss of a significant source of antibody production. Infection may occur at any time after splenectomy; in one recent series, most infections occurred more than 2 years after splenectomy, and 42% occurred more than 5 years after splenectomy.\"- Sabiston I8\/e The risk for OPSI is greater after splenectomy for malignancy or hematologic disease than for trauma. The risk also appears to be greater in young children (<4 years of age). OPSI may begin with a relatively mild-appearing prodrome, including fever, malaise, myalgias, headache, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms may then progress rapidly to fulminant bacteremic septic shock, with accompanying hypotension, anuria, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coma, and death within hours of presentation. The moality rate is between 50% and 70% for fully developed OPSI despite antibiotics and intensive care. Survivors often have a long and complicated hospital course with severe sequelae, such as peripheral gangrene requiring amputation, deafness from meningitis, mastoid osteomyelitis, bacterial endocarditis, and cardiac valvular destruction. S. pneumoniae is the most frequently involved organism in OPSI and is estimated to be responsible for between 50% and 90% of cases. Other organisms involved in OPSI include Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus species and other pneumococcal species, Salmonella species, and Capnocytophaga canimorsus (implicated in OPSI as a sequela of dog bites). Currently, the standard of care for postsplenectomy patients includes immunization within 2 weeks of splenectomy with: - polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine (PPV23), - H. influenzae type b conjugate, and - meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine Antibiotic prophylaxis--usually a single daily dose of penicillin or amoxicillin--is recommended for asplenic children. (Antibiotic prophylaxis is controversia. Schwaz 9\/e and Sabiston 18\/e advise chemoprophylaxis; but Harrison 17\/e does not recommend it)",

The optimal type offluid and timing of administration are not well established. We suggest isotonic bicarbonate rather than isotonic saline.o Despite conflicting data, we suggest that acetylcysteine be administered the day before and the day of the procedure, based upon its potentialfor benefit and low toxicity and cost. If acetylcysteine is administered, we suggest giving 1200 mg orally twice daily rather than 600 mg twice daily the day before and the day of the procedure.o Based upon the lack of convincing evidence of benefit and ihe potential risk of anaphylactoid reactions, we suggest not using intravenous acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast nephropathy. (Note: Oral acetylcysteine is used)o We recommend NOT using mannitol or other diuretics prophytactically.o Among patients with stage 3 and 4 CKD, we recommend NOTperforming prophylactic hemofiltration or hemodialysis after contrast exposure.o Among patients with stage 5 CKD, we suggest prophylactic hemodialysis after contrast exposure if there is already a functioning hemodialysis access.",

Supplemental oxygen administration which was for a long time considered as the important causative factor is now considered only a risk factor. \" - Khuran Ophthalmology 4\/e p264 \"ROP is confined to those with a birth weight of under 1.5 kg and\/or a gestational age of under 32 wks. \"- Parson 21\/e P310 The hallmark of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is abnormal retinal vasculature. Ophthalmologists diagnose and make decisions about the initial treatment of ROP based on the appearance of the retinal blood vessels. Dilatation and tortuosity of the retinal vessels at the posterior pole is termed 'plus' disease. It is a sign of rapidly progressive ROP and is an indication for early laser ablation of the peripheral avascular retina.Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)ROP is a bilateral proliferative retinopathy that develops in premature infants due to incomplete vasculogenesis of retina at the time of birth.During normal retinal development, vessels migrate from the optic disc to the ora serrata beginning at 16weeks of gestation. Capillary network is formed differentiating into mature vessels which extend to nasal ora by 36 wks and tangential ora by 39-41 wks.The pathogenesis of ROP begins with premature birth. Exposure of extrauterine environment causes phases of hyperoxia-vasocessation (obliteration of retinal vessels) and hypoxia-Vaso proliferation (neovascularization). VEGF is thought to be the most important molecule involved in the neovascularization.Neovascularization leads to retinal and vitreous changes which ultimately lead to retinal detachment.Classification of ROP:ROP is described using a number of parameters. These are location of the disease into zones (1, 2, and 3), the circumferential extent of the disease based on the clock hours (1-12), the severity of the disease (stage 1-5) and the presence or absence of \"Plus Disease\".Classification on the basis of severity, ROP is divided into 5 stages:-Stage I- the first sign of ROP (stage 1) is the appearance of a thin, fiat, white structure (termed a demarcation line) at the junction of vascularized retina posteriorly and avascular retina anteriorly.Stage II- the demarcation line develops into a pink or white elevation (ridge) of thickened tissueStage III- proliferation of vessels over the ridge and into vitreous (extra vitreal fibrovascular proliferation)Stage IV- partial retinal detachmentIVa- partial detachment with macular sparing IVb- partial detachment with macula involvedStage V- total retinal detachmentClassification on basis of anatomical location:-Since there is a direct correlation between severity of disease and amount of avascular retina, the location of the border between vascularized and avascular retina is an important prognostic sign.3 zones are divided to describe the location of ROP. Location of the border in zone 1 is the most severe disease and in zone 3 least.Zone 1 is defined as a circle, the center of which is the disc, and the radius of which is twice the distance of the disc to the fovea.Zone 2 is a doughnut-shaped region that extends from the anterior border of Zone 1 to within one disc-diameter of the ora serrata nasally and to the anatomic equator temporally.Zone 3 encompasses the residual temporal retina.Plus disease:- As ROP progresses, more and more shunting occurs in the neovascular tissue at the retinal vascular- avascular junction. This increased retinal vascular blood flow results in dilation and tortuosity of the major retinal arteries and veins in the posterior pole - described as \"plus disease\". Plus disease is the hallmark of rapidly progressive ROP and is notated by adding a plus sign after the number of the ROP stage.Management:Most of the cases (approx. 80%) of ROP resolve spontaneously, hence intervention is chosen according to the below given protocol.ROP is divided into Threshold and Pre threshold disease.Threshold disease: It is defined as stage 3+ ROP in Zones 1 or 2 occupying at least five contiguous clock-hours or eight noncontiguous clock-hours of retina.Treatment of Threshold disease is - Laser photocoagulation.Pre threshold disease is divided into 2 types:High risk or Type I - treatment is Laser photocoagulationLow risk or Type II - treatment is Weekly or Twice weekly observationType 1 Pre thresholdType 2 Pre thresholdZone I ROP (any stage) + Zone I, Stage 3 Zone II, Stage 2\/3 +Zone I, Stage 1\/2 - Zone II, Stage 3 -Laser PhotocoagulationWeekly or Twice weekly observationROP diseases less severe than Pre threshold are followed up.In this question, the child with zone 1, stage II 'plus' ROP falls into Pre threshold disease- Type 1 or high risk type, hence Laser Photocoagulation would be the management of choice.",

    "question": "Increased osmotic fragility is characteristic of:September 2009",
    "exp": "Ans. A: Hereditary spherocytosisThe normal red blood cell is a relatively impermeable biconcave disc which maintains osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding medium. As the surrounding medium becomes hypotonic, fluid will be taken into the cell to maintain stability. Eventually under very hypotonic conditions the cell will fill to capacity and rupture. Spherocytic red blood cells have a decreased capacity to expand, and will rupture in mildly hypotonic conditions that fail to lyse normal red cells. They thus exhibit increased osmotic fragility.Osmotic fragility is determined by measuring the degree of hemolysis in hypotonic saline solution. With the unincubated test, red cell osmotic fragility is considered to be increased if hemolysis occurs in a sodium chloride concentration > 0.5%. Although increased osmotic fragility is characteristically associated with hereditary spherocytosis, it may also be increased in other types of hemolytic anemia associated with the presence of spherocytes, paicularly auto-immune hemolytic anemia, and in hypernatermia (Na > 155 meq\/L).Often the increased osmotic fragility in spherocytosis is limited to a small fraction of cells that are unusually susceptible to lysis. After incubation, the defect is magnified, and a striking increase in fragility will be seen in hereditary spherocytosis. Osmotic fragility is considered to be decreased if hemolysis is not complete in a 0.30% NaC1 solution. Decreased osmotic fragility is associated with chronic liver disease, iron deficiency anemia, thalassemia, hyponatremia (Na < 130 meq\/ L), polycythemia vera, and sickle cell anemia after splenectomy.",

The pathophysiology is part of the in\ufb02ammatory spectrum, and the triggers are similar: infective and non-infective in\ufb02ammatory processes.

Local release of cytokines and chemokines by activated macrophages and neutrophils results in progressive recruitment of in\ufb02ammatory cells.

Malignant otitis externa (also k\/a Necrotizing external otitis) Malignant otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the external ear usually spreading deep to cause osteomyelitis of temporal bone and base of skull. It occurs primarily in immunocompromised persons, especially older persons with diabetes mellitus, and is often initiated by self-inflicted or iatrogenic trauma to the external auditory canal [May also be seen in pts. who received radiotherapy to skull base I The most frequent pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Others may be S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, Actinomyces, and some gram-negative bacterial. One of the hallmarkof malignant otitis externs is granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, especially at the hone-cailage junction. As the infection spreads to the temporal bone, it may extend into the cranium and result in cranial nerve palsies (commonly the facial nerve) Cranial nerve involvement indicates poor prognosis. Death is usually due to intracranial complications such as sigmoid sinus thrombosis. It has high moality rate due to which the name 'malignant' is used for this disease. Treatment Includes correction of immunosuppression (when possible), local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy, and in selected patients, surgery. - In all cases, the external ear canal is cleansed and a biopsy specimen of the granulation tissue sent for culture. - IV antibiotics is directed against the offending organism. - For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most common pathogen, the regimen involves an antipseudomonal penicillin or cephalosporin (3rd generation-piperacillin or ceftazidime) with an aminoglycoside. A fluoroquinolone antibiotic can be used in place of the aminoglycoside. Ear drops containing antipseudomonal antibiotic e.g. ciproflaxacin plus a glucocoticoid is also used. - Early cases can be managed with oral and otic fluoroquinolones only. - Extensive surgical debridement once an impoant pa of the treatment is now rarely needed.",

These guidelines clearly state that if the patient cannot cope with the procedure, one should attempt other strategies to handle the situation. The guidelines all acknowledge that, in some cases, radiographs are not possible, in which case, one should balance the benefit against the risk even more carefully. Sometimes it is better to postpone the radiographic exposure until the patient is older or better conditioned. The guidelines also clearly state that if there are no clinical signs of pathology, the need for a radiographic assessment is up to the professional\u2019s judgment, and that these decisions have to be made on an individual patient basis. Radiographs are never to be used for economic and screening reasons since they involve a potential health risk for the patient. A 3-year-old with a sound dentition and open proximal contacts does not need a radiographic assessment. In contrast, for a 3-year-old with only 10 teeth visible in the mouth and no history of dental treatment, the dental professional should make a radiographic assessment.

Consequently, the rays of light entering in the eye cannot converge to a point focus but form focal lines. The refractive error of the astigmatic eye stems from a difference in degree of curvature refraction of the two different meridians (i.e.,, the eye has different focal point in different planes). For example, the image may be clearly focused on retina in the horizontal plane, but not in the vertical plane.o The most common cause of astigmatism is abnormality of corneal curvature. Other less common causes are lenticular (curvature abnormality of lens,oblique position of lens) and retinal (oblique placement of macula). Types of astigmatismBased on axis of the principal meridiansRegular stigmatism : Principal meridians are perpendicularo With-the-rule astigmatism-the vertical meridian is steepest.o Against-the-rule astigmatism-the horizontal meridian is steepest.o Oblique astigmatism-the steepest curve lies in between 120 and 150 degrees and 30 and 60 degrees.Irregular astigmatism - principal meridians are not perpendicular.Based on focus of the principal meridiansSimple astigmatismo Simple hyperopic astigmatism - first focal line is on retina while the second is located behind the retinao Simple myopic astigmatism - first focal line is in front of the retina while the second is on the retina.Compound astigmatismo Compound hyperopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located behind the retina,o Compound myopic astigmatism-both focal lines are located in front of the retina.Mixed astigmatism-focal lines are on both sides of the retina (straddling the retina).Treatment of Astigmatismo Treatment of astigmatism consists : -Optical treatment: - It consists of cylindrical power spectacles or contact lens.

    "exp": "Urethral stricture CAUSES The common causes of urethral stricture are: * Inflammatory * Secondary to urethritis * Secondary to balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) * Traumatic (MC) * Bulbar urethral injury * Pelvic fracture urethral disruption injury * Iatrogenic * Secondary to urethral instrumentation including cath- eterisation and transurethral prostatectomy * Secondary to radical prostatectomy * Secondary to radiotherapy for prostate cancer * Idiopathic CLINICAL FEATURES Symptoms are usually hesitancy of micturition, straining to void and a poor urinary stream. The relative youthfulness of the patient often rules out prostatic enlargement, which characteristically occurs after the age of 50. As the stream becomes narrower, micturition is prolonged and is followed by postmicturition dribbling as a result of urine trickling from the dilated urethra proximal to the stricture. Urinary frequency by day and night is common and is due to incomplete bladder emptying, coexisting detrusor overactivity or urinary infection. If the stricture is tight enough, the patient will go into acute retention, although this is rare. If this happens, there is a danger that clumsy attempts to pass a urethral catheter will result in a false passage. If a patient has gone into retention because of a urethral stricture, its lumen will be too narrow to pass even a tiny catheter and suprapubic catheterisation is required. Investigation involves uroflowmetry, urethroscopy, urethrography and ultrasound scanning to assess bladder emptying and to detect any upper tract dilatation. The urinary flow rate is typically prolonged and plateau shaped while urethroscopy allows the stricture to be viewedas a circumferential scar. Openings of false passages commemorate previous misguided attempts to pass a urethral catheter. Urethrography using a water-soluble contrast medium will show the extent and severity of the stricture Ref: Bailey and love 27th edition Pgno : 1482",

Scar tissue formation may be secondary to previous granulomatous disease (tuberculosis), infarction, or interstitial diseases of the lung associated with fibrosis (e.g., progressive systemic sclerosis).

One theory is that scar tissue blocks lymphatic drainage, causing an increased concentration of anthracotic pigment-containing carcinogens.

Posterior urethral valve These are symmetrical folds of urothelium extending distally from prostatic urethra to external urinary sphincter. It most commonly lies just distal to the verumontanum or at the verumontanum* It occurs only in males. It behaves as flap valves so, although urine does not flow normally a urethral catheter can be passed without difficulty. Sometimes, the valves are incomplete and the patient remains without symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. Approximately 30% of patients experience end stage renal disease Vesicoureteral reflux occurs in 50% of patients. Diagnosis is made by (a) voiding cystourethrogram* & (b) endoscopy Both of these investigations clearly depict the site of obstruction. The diagnosis can be established prenatally by ultrasound.* Management First a small polyethylene feeding tube is inseed in the bladder and left for several days. Then fuher management is done according to serum creatinine level.

Prolonged sedation (>24 h at 0.1-0.6% isoflurane) of critically ill patients has resulted in elevated plasma fluoride levels (15-50 mmol\/L) without evidence of kidney impairment. Similarly, up to 20 MAC-hours of isoflurane may lead to fluoride levels exceeding 50 mmol\/L without detectable postoperative kidney dysfunction. Its limited oxidative metabolism also minimizes any possible risk of significant hepatic dysfunction. Total hepatic blood flow (hepatic aery and poal vein flow) may be reduced during isoflurane anesthesia. Hepatic oxygen supply is better-maintained with isoflurane than with halothane, however, because hepatic aery perfusion is preserved. Liver function tests are usually not affected. The major effect of acute inhalation of chloroform is central nervous system depression. At concentrations from 1,500-30,000 ppm, chloroform exposure can induce anesthesia; at concentrations exceeding 40,000 ppm, it can be fatal. Chronic inhalation of chloroform in humans results in hepatotoxicity and central nervous symptoms such as depression and irritability. Meanwhile, chronic oral exposure to chloroform in humans results in effects on the blood, livers, and kidneys.

    "exp": "The metabisulfite test is used to detect the presence of hemoglobin S, but it does not differentiate the heterozygous sickle cell trait from the homozygous sickle cell disease. The test is based on the fact that erythrocytes with a large propoion of hemoglobin S sickle in solutions of low oxygen content. Metabisulfite is a reducing substance that enhances the process of deoxygenation. The osmotic fragility test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. Spherocytes lyse at a higher concentration of salt than do normal cells, thus causing an increased osmotic fragility. The direct antiglobulin test (DAT), or Coombs' test, is used to differentiate autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) due to the presence of anti-red cell antibodies from other forms of hemolytic anemia. In this test, antibodies to human immunoglobulin cause the agglutination (clotting) of red cells if these anti-red cell antibodies are present on the surface of the red cells. In patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, the erythrocytes are excessively sensitive to complement-mediated lysis in low ionic environments (the basis for the sucrose hemolysis test) or in acidotic conditions, such as sleep, exercise, or the Ham's acid hemolysis test. The Schilling test, which measures intestinal absorption of vitamin B12 with and without intrinsic factor, is used to diagnose decreased vitamin B12 caused by pernicious anemia, which is characterized by a lack of intrinsic factor.

    "exp": "<p>Improved medical management of chronic kidney disease now allows many patients to survive for decades and hence time enough to develop features of renal osteodystrophy, which must be controlled to avoid additional morbidity. Impaired production of 1,25(OH) 2 D is now thought to be the principal factor that causes calcium deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone disease; hyperphosphatemia typically occurs only in the later stages of CKD. Low levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D due to increased FGF23 production in bone are critical in the development of hypocalcemia. The uremic state also causes impairment of intestinal absorption by mechanisms other than defects in vitamin D metabolism. Nonetheless, treatment with supraphysiologic amounts of vitamin D or calcitriol corrects the impaired calcium absorption. Since increased FGF23 levels are seen even in early stages of renal failure in some patients, and have been repoed to correlate with increased moality, there is current interest in methods (lowering phosphate absorption) to lower FGF23 levels and concern as to whether vitamin D supplementation (known physiologically to increase FGF23) increases FGF23 in CKD. Hyperphosphatemia in renal failure lowers blood calcium levels by several mechanisms, including extraosseous deposition of calcium and phosphate, impairment of the bone-resorbing action of PTH, and reduction in 1,25(OH) 2 D production by remaining renal tissue(harrison 18 pg 3116)<\/p>",

The facial nucleus, which is located within the pons, is divided in half, the upper neurons innervate the upper muscles of the face, while the lower neurons innervate the lower poion of the face. It is impoant to realize that each half receives input from the contralateral motor coex, while only the upper half receives input from the ipsilateral motor coex. Therefore an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion will produce a defect involving only the contralateral lower half of the face. Causes of UMN lesions involving the facial nerve includes strokes that involve the coex or the internal capsule. In contrast, lesions that affect the facial nerve from the facial nucleus to the remaining length of the nerve result in LMN lesions.

Patients present with paralysis of all muscles of facial expression. Bell's phenomenon refers to the finding of the affected eye looking up and out when patients try to close their eyes.

This is k\/a degeneracy or redundancy.The genetic code is made up of codons. Codons consist of a sequence of three nucleotides i.e. it is a triplet code. Since there are 4 different nucleotides, their various combination leads to 64 codons (43). Three of these codons do not code for any specific amino acid (known as nonsense codons) and are used as termination signals (hence also known as termination or stop codons. When one of these termination codons appear in an mRNA sequence, it signals that polymerization of amino acids into a protein molecule is complete.Characteristics of the Genetic CodeSpecific or UnambiguousA given codon designates only one single specific amino acid.Degenerate or RedundantAlthough each codon corresponds to a single amino acid, a given amino acid may have more than one triplet coding for it.Exceptions are Methionine & Tryptophan, which have a single codon.Codons that represent same amino acids are called as synonymsIn general, the third nucleotide in a codon is less important than the first two in determining the specific amino acid.

The choice of modality differs according to anatomic location and institutional expeise. In early laryngeal cancer generally, radiotherapy is done to preserve voice while in early oral cavity cancers, surgery is preferred to avoid the long-term complication of radiation such as xerostomia and dental decay. b) Locally or advanced regional disease - Combined modality therapy including surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is used.

Management of neck lymph nodes The neck lymph nodes should be treated when there are clinically positive nodes or the risk for occult disease is high based on the location and stage of the primary lesion. The decision to perform neck dissection or irradiate the neck is related to the treatment of the primary lesion. If the primary tumor is being treated with radiation and the neck is N0 or N1, the nodes are usually treated with irradiation. For surgically treated primary lesions, N0 or N1 neck disease may be treated surgically as well (Radical neck dissection\/Modified neck dissection\/Selective neck dissection). Negative prognostic factors such as extracapsular spread of tumor, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, fixation to surrounding structures, and multiple positive nodes are indicators for postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy.

With early detection, the five-year survival rate for DCIS is nearly 100%, provided that the cancer has not spread past the milk ducts to the fatty breast tissue or any other regions of the body. There are several different types of DCIS. For example, ductal comedocarcinoma refers to DCIS with necrosis (areas of dead or degenerating cancer cells). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC): IDC is also known as invasive ductal carcinoma.

This is called Bragg peak.When a fast charged particle moves through matter, it ionizes atoms of the material and deposits a dose along its path.A peak occurs because the interaction cross section increases as the charged particle's energy decreases.Absorption of a beam of energetic photons (X- ravs) which is entirely different in nature; the curve is mainly exponential.The phenomenon is exploited in particle therapy of cancer, to concentrate the effect of light ion beams on the tumor being treated while minimizing the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue.Monenergistic proton beam with the sharp peak is widened by increasing the range of energies, so that a larger tumor volume can be treated.This can be achieved by using variable thickness attenuators like spinning wedges.",

    "question": "What is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome",
    "exp": "Ans. b. Sodium and water retention Sodium and water retention is the pathology of edema in nephrotic syndrome. The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and hypoalbuminemia. Renal sodium retention and changes in variables of the Starling equation are fundamental to the pathophysiology of nephrotic edema. There is evidence for both intravascular volume expansion (overfilling) and intravascular volume depletion (under filling) in patients with nephrosis. Microvascular fluid exchange is described using a formulation of the Starling driving forces (DP and Dp) and it is through this equation that nephrotic edema is conceptualized. Previous theories have focused on abnormalities in DP and Dp to explain nephrotic edema. Studies have shown that hypoalbuminemia (and thus Dp) is not a likely cause of edema formation in most nephrotic patients owing to a parallel decrease in interstitial fluid albumin and an increase in interstitial fluid pressure, both of which serve to maintain edema driving forces constant. There is limited evidence suggesting that abnormalities in vascular permeability (Kf and s) may contribute to edema formation. A major advance in our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome is the discovery that proteinuria can cause primary renal sodium retention through ENaC activation. This mechanism is likely active in all patients with nephrotic syndrome, regardless of their intravascular volume status. Other causes of primary renal sodium retention include increased renal efferent sympathetic nerve activity, ANPase, and in the expression and activity of the Ne--le in the collecting duct in animal models. Fuhermore, excess serum vasopressin levels have been found to contribute to free water retention in some patients with the nephrotic syndrome.\"- Eric Siddall and Jai Radhakrishnan.

Red (or hemorrhagic) infarcts: They found in tissues that have a double blood supply--eg, lung and liver--or in tissues such as intestine that have collateral vessels permitting some continued flow into the area although the amount is not sufficient to prevent infarction. The infarct is red because of extravasation of blood in the infarcted area from necrotic small vessels. Red infarcts may also occur in tissue if dissolution or fragmentation of the occluding thrombus permits reestablishment of aerial flow to the infarcted area. Venous infarcts are always associated with congestion and hemorrhage. They are red infarcts. Ref: Chandrasoma P., Taylor C.R. (1998). Chapter 9. Abnormalities of Blood Supply. In P. Chandrasoma, C.R.

The condition was named after the yellowish (ocher-like) discoloration of the tissue seen on microscopic examination. However, macroscopically the affected tissues appear bluish grey because of a light scattering phenomenon known as the Tyndall effect. The condition is most often associated with alkaptonuria but can occur from exogenous administration of phenol complexes like hydroquinone.Alkaptonuria (black urine disease or alcaptonuria) is a rare inherited genetic disorder of phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. This is an autosomal recessive condition that is due to a defect in the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase, which participates in the degradation of tyrosine. As a result, a toxic tyrosine byproduct called homogentisic acid (or alkapton) accumulates in the blood and is excreted in urine in large amounts (hence -uria)",

Physiological abnormalities resulting from OSA include hypoxemia, hypercapnia, pulmonary and systemic vasoconstriction, and secondary polycythemia (from recurrent hypoxemia). These result in an increased risk of ischemic hea disease and cerebrovascular disease. Right ventricular failure can occur from hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Obesity is now considered to be the second leading cause of preventable death behind cigarette smoking. The incidence of comorbidities and moalities is directly related to the degree of obesity. in a study with 12 year follow up, moalities rates for those weighing 50% over average weight were doubled.

    "question": "The antimicrobial agent which inhibits the ergosterol biosynthesis is:",
    "exp": "IMIDAZOLES AND TRIAZOLES: These are presently the most extensively used antifungal drugs. Four irnidazoles are entirely topical, while ketoconazole is used both orally and topically. Two triazoles fluconazole and itraconazole have largely replaced ketoconazole for systemic mycosis because of greater efficacy, longer tlh, fewer side effects and drug interactions. The imidazoles and triazoles have broadspectrum antifungal activity covering dermatophytes, Candida, other fungi involved in deep mycosis (except mucor), Nocardia, some grampositive and anaerobic bacteria, e.g. Staph. aureus, Strep. faecal is, Bac. fragilis and Leishmania. The mechanism of action of irnidazoles and triazoles is the same. They inhibit the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme &;lanosterol l4--demethylase&; and thus impair ergosterol synthesis leading to a cascade of membrane abnormalities in the fungus. The lower host toxicity of triazoles compared to irnidazoles has correlated with their lower affinity for mammalian CYP450 enzymes and lesser propensity to inhibit mammalian sterol synthesis. However, because they are active against ceain bacteria as well (which do not have ergosterol), other mechanisms of action also appear to be involved. Ketoconazole (KTZ): It is the first orally effective broad-spectrum antifungal drug, useful in both dermatophytosis and deep myc osis. The oral absorption of KTZ is facilitated by gastric acidity because it is more soluble at lower pH. Hepatic metabolism is extensive; metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces. Elimination of KTZ is dose dependent: tlh varies from llh to 6 hours. Penetration in CSF is poor: not effective in fungal men ingitis.

    "question": "False rejection of a true null hypothesis is due to?",
    "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Type I error Statistical errors Statistical errors are used to describe possible errors made in statistical decision. Before reading about the types of error you must know null hypothesis because these tests are related to null hypothesis. Null hypothesis says - Any kind of difference or significance you see in a set of data is due to chance and not significant that means there is no variation (difference) exists between variables. Null hypothesis testing (e.g., in Chisquare test) is used to make a decision about whether : - i) The data contradict the null hypothesis - That means there is true difference (which is significant) between variables and it is not due to chance. Or ii) The data approve the null hypothesis There is no difference between variables and the difference you see is due to chance. Now see types of error :? There are two basic type of statistical errors : ? Type I error Type II error Type I error It is also known as an error of first kind or a-error or false positive. This type of error rejects null hypothesis when it is true - False rejection of null hypothesis. That means in real there is no difference (as null hypothesis says) but we observe a difference (by rejecting the null hypotesis due to error). In very simple words \"we observe a difference when it is not true\" - false positive. One of the simplest example of this would be if a test shows that a women is pregnant when in reality she is not, i.e., she is false positive for pregnancy. Probability of type-I error is given by 'P-value' (probability of declaring a significant difference when actually it is not present). Significance (a) level is the maximum tolerable probability of type I error. Significance (a) level is fixed in advance and calculation of P value (probability of type I error) can be less than, equal to or greater than the significance (a) level. If the probability of type I error (P -value) is less than significance (a) level, the results are declared statistically significant. Therefore, to declare the results statistical significant, type I error (a-level) should be kept to minimum . Type I error is more serious that type II error. Type II error It is also known as an error or second kind or A-error or false negative. This type of error accept\/fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is false False acceptance of null hypothesis. That means we fail to observe a difference when in truth there is one - False negative. An example of this would be if a test shows that a woman is not pregnant when in reality she is i.e., she is false negative.",

It is a major agent of schistosomiasis; more specifically, it is associated with urinary schistosomiasis. Adults are found in the Venous plexuses around the urinary bladder and the released eggs traverse the wall of the bladder causing haematuria and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes calcified, and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys otherwise known as hydronephrosis. Inflammation of the genitals due to S. haematobium may contribute to the propagation of HIV. Studies have shown the relationship between S. haematobium infection and the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder Life cycle The female fluke lays as many as 30 eggs per day which migrate to the lumen of the urinary bladder and ureters. The eggs are eliminated from the host into the water supply with micturition. In fresh water, the eggs hatch forming free swimming miracidia which penetrate into the intermediate snail host (Bulinus spp., e.g. B. globosus, B. forskalii, B. nyassanus and B. truncatus). Inside the snail, the miracidium sheds it epithelium and develops into a mother sporocyst. After two weeks the mother begins forming daughter sporocysts. Four weeks after the initial penetration of the miracardium into the snail furcocercous cercariae begin to be released. The cercariae cycle from the top of the water to the bottom for three days in the search of a human host. Within half an hour the cercariae enter the host epithelium",

    "question": "A patient with leukemia on chemotherapy develops acute right lower abdominal pain associated with anemia, thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Which of following is the clinical diagnosis -",
    "exp": "Neutropenic enterocolitis (NE) is also known as typhlitis, ileocecal syndrome, cecitis, or necrotizing enterocolitis. Despite the previous use of the term \"necrotizing enterocolitis\" to describe NE cases, necrotizing enterocolitis is a different inflammatory illness seen in newborns and is beyond the scope of this review. NE is a clinical entity initially described in leukemic pediatric patients. It has also been repoed in adults with hematologic malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes, as well as other immunosuppressive causes such as AIDS, therapy for solid tumors, and organ transplant. The true incidence of NE is unknown. One systematic review published in 2005 suggested a pooled incidence of 5.6% in hospitalized adults with hematological malignancies, chemotherapy for solid tumors, and aplastic anemia. The repoed moality also varies with rates as high as 50%. NE was repoed initially after the use of taxane drugs, but more recently an increasing number of chemotherapeutic drugs have been implicated. Other drugs linked to NE include cytosine arabinoside, gemcitabine, vincristine, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, leuvocorin, and daunorubicin. Immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant, antibiotics, and sulfasalazine for the treatment of rheumatoid ahritis have also been considered causes of NE. PATHOGENESIS The exact pathogenesis of NE is not completely understood. The main elements in disease onset appear to be intestinal mucosal injury together with neutropenia and the immunocompromised state of the afflicted patients. These initial conditions lead to intestinal edema, engorged vessels, and a disrupted mucosal surface, which becomes more vulnerable to bacterial intramural invasion. Chemotherapeutic agents can cause direct mucosal injury (mucositis) or can predispose to distension and necrosis, thereby altering intestinal motility. Cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine) is a chemotherapeutic agent used to treat leukemia and lymphoma that is paicularly associated with the development of NE. Intestinal leukemic infiltration is another potential factor in the pathogenesis of NE, which may explain the presence of acute myelogenous leukemia presenting as NE before the onset of chemotherapy regimens Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 836",

The symptoms last for 30 seconds and then resolve completely. He has no hearing change or other neurologic symptoms, and his physical examination is completely normal. A Dix-Hallpike maneuver reproduces his symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for his vertigo symptoms?",
    "exp": "This person has benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is characterized by sudden-onset brief episodes of vertigo lasting less than a minute. The symptoms are usually brought on by head movement. The cause is commonly attributed to calcium debris in the semicircular canals, known as canalithiasis. The debris is loose otoconia (calcium carbonate) within the utricular sac. Although BPPV can occur after head trauma, there is usually no obvious precipitating factor. It generally abates spontaneously and can be treated with vestibular rehabilitation. Basilar migraine can cause vertigo, but it is not brought on by movement, there is an associated headache and lasts longer than the 30 seconds noticed in this patient. Brainstem ischemic events or cerebellar tumors can cause vertigo but the symptoms are persistent and not intermittent. Finally, Meniere disease also causes vertigo but there is associated hearing changes, and the symptoms last longer than in BPPV.",

    "question": "Which is the most common site of metastatic disease-",
    "exp": "Invasion and metastasis are complex processes involving multiple discrete steps; they begin with local tissue invasion, followed byinfiltration of nearby blood and lymphatic vessels by cancer cells.Malignant cells are eventually transpoed through haematogenousand lymphatic spread to distant sites within the body, where theyform micrometastases that will eventually grow into macroscopicmetastatic lesions Cadherin-1 (CDH1) is a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesionglycoprotein that facilitates assembly of organised cell sheets intissues, and increased expression is recognised as an antagonistof invasion and metastasis. In situ tumours usually retain CDH1production, whereas loss of CDH1 production due to down-regulation or occasional mutational inactivation of CDH1 hasbeen observed in human cancers, suppoing the theory thatCDH1 plays a key role in suppression of invasion and metastasis.Cross-talk between cancer cells and cells of the surroundingstromal tissue is involved in the acquired capability for invasivegrowth and metastasis. Mesenchymal stem cells in tumourstroma have been found to secrete CCL5, a protein chemokinethat helps recruit leucocytes into inflammatory sites. With thehelp of paicular T-cell-derived cytokines (interleukin (IL)-2and interferon-gamma (IFN-g)), CCL5 induces proliferation andactivation of natural killer cells and then acts reciprocally oncancer cells to stimulate invasive behaviour. Macrophages atthe tumour periphery can foster local invasion by supplyingmatrix-degrading enzymes such as metalloproteinases andcysteine cathepsin proteases.The lungs, liver, brain, and bones are the most common metastasis locations from solid tumors.

An EDH is nearly always associated with a skull fracture and is more common in young male patients. The skull fracture is asso- ciated with tearing of a meningeal artery and a haematoma accumulates in the space between bone and dura. The most common site is temporal, as the pterion is not only the thinnest part of the skull but also overlies the largest meningeal artery - the middle meningeal.# An EDH may also occur in other regions such as frontal as well as in the posterior fossa. They are not always arte- rial: disruption of a major dural venous sinus can result in an EDH. The force required to sustain a skull fracture can be surprisingly small - a fall from standing or a single blow to the head.# The classical presentation of an EDH, occurring in less than one-third of cases, is initial injury followed by a lucid interval when the patient complains of a headache but is fully alert and orientated with no focal deficit. After minutes or hours a rapid deterioration occurs, with contralateral hemiparesis, reduced conscious level and ipsilateral pupillary dilatation as a result of brain compression and herniation.FEATUREEDH (EXTRADURAL HEMATOMA)SDH (SUBDURAL HEMATOMA)Incidence1-4%10-20%EtiologyLacerated middle meningeal artery\/ dural sinus in 70 to 85% cases.Stretching, tearing of bridging cortical veins.AgeAnyOlder peoplefractureSeen in 85-95% cases-LocationBetween skull & dura.95% supratentorialCrosses dural attachments but not sutures.Between dura & arachnoid95% supratentorialCrosses suture but not dural attachmentBilateral5%15%CT- Biconvex (lentiform shape)- 2\/3 hyperdense (- 1\/3 mixed density)- Displace greywhite interfacea) Acute SDH: Crescentic & hyperdenseb) Subacute SDH: May be nearly isodense with cortex neo-membrane, underlying vessels may enhance.c) Chronic SDH: Hypodense with enhancing membrane.

This is so because action alobe does not amount to guilt unless if is accompanied by a guilty mind. And, a child of that tender age cannot have a guilty mind or criminal intention with which the act is done. This presumption, however, is only confined to offenses under the IPC but not to other Acts, e.g., the Railway Act.83A child above seven and under twelve years of age is presumed to be capable of committing an offence it he has obtained sufficient maturity to understand and judge the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. The law presumes such maturity' in a child of that age unless the contrary is proved by the defence.89A child under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent to suffer any harm which can occur from an act done in good faith and for its benefit, e.g., a consent for an operation. Only, a guardian can give such consent.87A person under 12 years of age cannot give valid consent, whether express or implied, to suffer any harm which may result from an act no intended or not known to cause death or grievous hurt e.g. consent for a wrestling contest.84Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is uncapable of knowing the nature of act (i.e. it is wrong or contrary to law).85,86Drunkness and criminal responsibilityQ",

    "question": "All are true about ketone bodies except",
    "exp": "KETOSIS Under ceain metabolic conditions associated with a high rate of fatty acid oxidation, liver produces considerable quantities of compounds like acetoacetate and bbb-OH butyric acid, which pass by diffusion into the blood. Acetoacetate continually undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to produce acetone. These three substances are collectively known as \"ketone bodies\" (or \"acetone bodies\"). Sometimes also called as \"ketones\", which is rather a misnomer. KETONE BODY FORMATION IN LIVER (KETOGENESIS) Enzymes are mitochondrial: Steps 1. Aceto-acetyl-CoA: Aceto-acetyl-CoA is the staing material for ketogenesis. This can arise in two ways: (a)Directly during the course of b-oxidation of fatty acids, or (b)As a result of condensation of two C-2 units, i.e. 'active acetate' (acetyl-CoA) by reversal of thiolase reaction. 2. Formation of Acetoacetate: Acetoacetate is the first ketone body to be formed. This can occur in two ways: a) By deacylation: Acetoacetate can be formed from aceto-acetyl-CoA by simple deacylation catalysed by the enzyme aceto-acetyl-CoA deacylase. SECTION FOUR when excessive amount of ketone bodies are formed, the The above does not seem to be the major pathway deacylation reaction is not enough to cope up. (b) Second pathway: Formation of acetoacetate intermediate production of \"bbb-OH-bbb-methyl glutaryl CoA\" (HMG-CoA). Present opinion ours the HMG-CoA pathway as the major route of ketone body formation. Steps Involves two steps: * Condensation of aceto-acetyl-CoA with another molecule of acetyl-CoA to form b-OH-b methyl glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) catalysed by the enzyme HMG-CoA synthase (mitochondrial enzyme). *HMG-CoA is then acted upon by an another enzyme, HMG-CoA Lyase, which is also mitochondrial enzyme, to produce one molecule \"acetoacetate\" and one molecule of acetyl-CoA (Fig. 25.10). Note *Both the enzymes HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA Lyase are mitochondrial and must be available in mitocondrion for ketogenesis to occur. *Both the enzymes are present in liver cells mitochon- dria only. *A marked increase in activity of HMG-CoA Lyase has been noted in fasting. *HMG-CoA is a committed step. Cholesterol also can be formed by \"HMG-CoA reductase\". 3. Formation of Acetone: As stated earlier, acetone is formed from acetoacetate by spontaneous decarboxy- lation (Non-enzymatic). 4.Formation of b-OH Butyrate: Acetoacetate once formed is conveed to b-OH-butyric acid; the reaction is catalysed by the enzyme b-OH-butyrate dehydro- genase, which is present in liver and also found in many other tissues. b-OH-butyrate is quantitatively the predominant ketone body present in blood and urine in KetosisRef: Textbook of Medical Biochemistry Dr (Brig) MN Chatterjea Rana Shinde, page no: 425,426",

    "exp": "The afferent fibers mediating the pain from the head of the pancreas run initially with the greater thoracic splanchnic nerves. The greater splanchnic nerves arise from sympathetic ganglia at the levels of T5 to T9 and innervate structures of the foregut and thus the head of the pancreas. Running within these nerves are visceral afferent fibers that relay pain from foregut structures to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Also entering the dorsal horn are the somatic afferents from that vertebral level, which mediate pain from the body wall. Intercostal nerves T1 to T12 provide the terminal part of the pathway to the spinal cord of visceral afferents for pain from the thorax and much of the abdomen. Therefore, pain fibers from the pancreas pass by way of the splanchnic nerves to the sympathetic chains and then, by way of communicating rami, to ventral rami of intercostal nerves, finally entering the spinal cord by way of the dorsal roots. The phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm and also carries visceral afferents from mediastinal pleura and the pericardium, but it does not carry with it any visceral afferent fibers from the pancreas. The vagus nerve innervates the pancreas with parasympathetic fibers and ascends all the way up to the medulla where it enters the brain. It has no visceral afferent fibers for pain.

    "question": "Liposomal amphotericin B has the following advantage over conventional amphotericin B:",
    "exp": "Amphotericin B (AMB): It is obtained from Streptomyces nodosus. Chemistry and mechanism of action The polyenes possess a macrocyclic ring, one side of which has several conjugated double bonds and is highly lipophilic, while the other side is hydrophilic with many OH groups. A polaraminosugar and a carboxylic acid group are present at one end in some. They are all insoluble in water and unstable in aqueous medium. The polyenes have high affinity for ergosterol present in fungal cell membrane: combine with it, get inseed into the membrane and several polyene molecules together orient themselves in such a way as to form a &;micropore&;. The hydrophilic side forms the interior of the pore through which ions, amino acids and other watersoluble substances move out. The micropore is stabilized by membrane sterols which fill up the spaces between the AMB molecules on the lipophilic side-constituting the outer surface of the pore. Thus, cell permeability is markedly increased. New amphotericin B formulations In an attempt to improve tolerability of i.v. infusion of AMB, reduce its toxicity and achieve targeted delivery, 3 new lipid formulations of AMB have been produced. (a) Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC): Contains 35% AMB incorporated in ribbon like paicles of dimyristoyl phospholipids. ( b ) Amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCO). Disc shaped paicles containing 50% each of AMB and cholesteryl sulfate are prepared as aqueous dispersion (c) Lpi osomal amphotericin B (small unilamellar vesicles SUV): Consists of 10% AMB incorporated in uniform sized (60-80 nM) unilamellar liposomes made up of lecithin and other biodegradable phospholipids. The special features of these preparations are: * They, except ABCD, produce milder acute reaction (especially liposomal formulation) on i.v. infusion. * They can be used in patients not tolerating infusion oi conventional AMB formulation. * They have lower nephrotoxicity. * They cause minimal anaemia. * The liposomal preparation delivers AMB paicularh* to reticuloendothelial cells in liver and spleen-----especialh valuable for kala azar and in immunocompromised patients. However, some preparations, especially ABLC and ABCD, produce lower AMB levels and their clinical efficacy relative to conventional formulations appear to be lower. Though none of the above formulations is more effectivein deep mycosis than conventional AMB, the liposomal AMB reduces equivalent blood levels, has similar clinical efficacy with less acute reaction and renal toxicity. It thus apears more satisfactory. ESSENTIALS OF MEDICAL PHARMACOLOGY K.D.TRIPATHI SIXTH EDITION PAGE NO:757,758,759",

Chronic AUB was defined as &;bleeding from the uterine corpus that is abnormal in volume, regularity and\/or timing that has been present for the majority of the last 6 months. AUB may affect females of all ages. Factors that influence incidence most greatly are age and reproductive status. A structured approach for establishing the cause using the FIGO PALM COEIN classification system will facilitate accurate diagnosis and inform treatment options. In the reproductive age group , the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis matures, and anovulatory uterine bleeding is encountered less often. The diagnostic goal is exclusion of pregnancy and identification of the underlying pathology to allow optimal treatment. Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies, and hydatidiform moles may cause life-threatening hemorrhage. Pregnancy complications are quickly excluded with determination of urine and serum Beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG levels). This is typically obtained on all reproductive-aged women. Other options: Pap smear evaluation is usually done for cervical and endometrial cancers which are commonly seen in peri and post menopausal women. Transvaginal sonography (TVS) typically offers greater patient comfo and suitable detection of postmenopausal endometrial hyperplasia and cancer compared to transabdominal ultrasonography.

This occurs at following sites.Complex I (NADH to CoQ) is inhibited by: - Barbiturates (amobarbital), Piericidin A (an antibiotic), rotenone (an insectiside), chlorpromazine (a tranquilizer), and guanethidine (an antihypertensive). These inhibitors block the transfer of reducing equivalents from FeS protein to CoQ.Complex II is inhibited by : - Carboxin and TTFA inhibit transfer of electon from FADH2 to CoQ, whereas malanate competitively inhibit from succinate to complex II.Complex III (Cytochrome b to cytochrome Cl) is inhibited by : - Dimercaprol, antimycin A, BAL (British anti lewisite), Naphthyloquinone. These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome b to cytochrome C i.Complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) is inhibited by : - Carbon monoxide, CN-, ITS and azide (N3). These inhibitors block the transfer of electrons from cytochrome aa3 to molecular oxygen and therefore can totally arrest cellular respiration.Inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylationThese compounds directly inhibit phosphorylation of ADP to .ATP. Oligomycin inhibits Fo component of F0F1 ATPase. Atractiloside inhibits translocase, a transport protein that transports ADP into mitochondria for phosphorylation into ATP.UncouplesAs the name suggests, these componds block the coupeling of oxidation with phosphorylation. These compounds allow the transfer of reducing equivalents in respiratory chain but prevent the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP by uncoupling the linkage between ETC and phosphorylation. Thus the energy instead of being trapped by phosphory lation is dissipated as heat.

This would be expected to speed impulse propagation in such tissues, reversing the myocyte depression seen with severe hyperkalemia. The effects of intravenous calcium occur within 1 to 3 minutes but last for only 30 to 60 minutes. Therefore, fuher, more definitive treatment is needed to lower serum potassium levels. Calcium gluconate is the preferred preparation of intravenous calcium. The dose should be 10 mL of a 10% calcium gluconate solution infused over 2 to 3 minutes.",

    "question": "True about carotid body receptors ?",
    "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Dopamine is neurotransmitter Peripheral chemoreceptors The peripheral chemoreceptors which regulate respiration are located in the carotid body and aoic bodies. These bodies are located in the connective tissue associated with the vessel wall, at the bifurcation of the common carotid, and on the arch of aoa, respectively. The characteristic cells of both these structures are called glomus cells. Type I glomus cells have a high dopamine content, which they possibly employ as a neurotransmetter. Peripheral chemoreceptors convey information to the DRG of neurons in medulla, for which purpose the afferent neurons from the carotid bodies pass through glossopharyngeal nerve and from the aoic bodies pass through vagus nerve. The most potent natural stimulus for peripheral chemoreceptors is low aerial P02 (hypoxic hypoxia). The other stimuli which activate peripheral chemoreceptors are high aerial PCO2, and an increase in aerial hydrogen ion concentration (acidosis or low pH). The response to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors is an increase in pulmonary ventilation through an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. The blood flow to peripheral chemoreceptors, on per unit mass basis, is the highest to any tissue in the body. With a blood flow of 2000 ml\/min\/100 gm tissue, the carotid and aoic bodies, inspite of their high metabolic rate, hardly remove any oxygen from the blood supplies to them. That is why the aeriovenous oxygen difference is negligible in these bodies. Thus these structures are idealy built to sense change in aerial P02. It is good to keep in mind that stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors not only stimulates medullary respiratory centers but also medullary vasomotor center. Therefore, the response to their stimulation is tachycardia, vasoconstriction and increase BP along with hyperventilation.",

    "question": "Which of the following is not an inflammatory mediator",
    "exp": "steps: (1) migration and proliferation of fibroblasts into the site of injury and (2) deposition of ECM proteins produced by these cells. The recruitment and activation of fibroblasts to syn- thesize connective tissue proteins are driven by many growth factors, including PDGF, FGF-2 (described earlier), and TGF-b. The major source of these factors is inflamma- tory cells, paicularly macrophages, which are present at sites of injury and in granulation tissue. Sites of inflamma- tion are also rich in mast cells, and in the appropriate chemotactic milieu, lymphocytes may be present as well. Each of these cell types can secrete cytokines and growth factors that contribute to fibroblast proliferation and activation. As healing progresses, the number of proliferating fibroblasts and new vessels decreases; however, the fibro- blasts progressively assume a more synthetic phenotype, so there is increased deposition of ECM. Collagen synthe- sis, in paicular, is critical to the development of strength in a healing wound site. As described later, collagen syn- thesis by fibroblasts begins early in wound healing (days 3 to 5) and continues for several weeks, depending on the size of the wound. Net collagen accumulation, however, depends not only on increased synthesis but also on diminished collagen degradation (discussed later). Ulti- mately, the granulation tissue evolves into a scar composed of largely inactive, spindle-shaped fibroblasts, dense collagen, fragments of elastic tissue, and other ECM com- ponents (Fig. 2-30, B). As the scar matures, there is proA A gressive vascular regression, which eventually transforms the highly vascularized granulation tissue into a pale, largely avascular scar. Growth Factors Involved in ECM Deposition and Scar Formation Many growth factors are involved in these processes, including TGF-b, PDGF, and FGF. Because FGF also is involved in angiogenesis, it was described earlier. Here we briefly describe the major propeies of TGF-b and PDGF. * Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) belongs to a family of homologous polypeptides (TGF-b1, -b2, and -b3) that includes other cytokines such as bone morphogenetic proteins. The TGF-b1 isoform is widely distributed and is usually referred to as TGF-b. The active factor binds to two cell surface receptors with serine-threonine kinase activity, triggering the phosphorylation of transcription factors called Smads. TGF-b has many and often oppo- site effects, depending on the cell type and the metabolic state of the tissue. In the context of inflammation and repair, TGF-b has two main functions: TGF-b stimulates the production of collagen, fibro- nectin, and proteoglycans, and it inhibits collagen degradation by both decreasing proteinase activity and increasing the activity of tissue inhibitors of pro- teinases known as TIMPs (discussed later on). TGF-b is involved not only in scar formation after ref Robbins 9\/e p83",

    "question": "Cognitive model of depression is given by ?",
    "exp": "Beck Cognitive therapy is a psychotherapy developed by American pyschiatrist Aaron T. Beck. Cognitive therapy is one of the therapeutic approaches within the larger group of cognitive behavioural therapies. Cognitive therapy seeks to help the client overcome difficulties by identifying and changing dysfunctional thinking, behaviour and emotional responses. This involves helping clients develop skills for modifying beliefs, identifying distoed thinkings, relative to others in different ways and changing behaviours. Treatment is based on collaboration between client and therapist and on testing beliefs. Therapy may consist of testing the assumptions which one makes and identifying how some of one's usually unquestioned thoughts are distoed, unrealistic and unhelpful. Once, those thoughts have been challenged, ones feelings about the subject matter of those thoughts are more easily subject to change. Beck initially focussed on depression and developed a list of errors in thought that he proposed could maintain depression, including arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, over generalization and magnification (of negatives) and minimization (of positives). According to Beck's theorey of the etiology of depression, depressed people acquire a negative view of the world in childhood and adolescence. Children and adolescent who suffer from depression acquire this negative view earlier. Depressed people acquire such view through a loss of a parent, rejection by peers, (criticism from teachers or parents, the depressive attitude and other negative events). When the person with such view encounters a situation that resembles the original conditions of the learned view in some way, even remotely, the negative views of the persons are activated. A simple example may illustrate the principle of how cognitive therapy works Having made a mistake at work, a person may believe \"I am useless and can't do anything right at work\". Strongly believing this then tends to worsen his mood. The problem may be worsened fuher if the individual reacts by avoiding activities and then behaviourally confirming the negative belief to himself. As a result, any adaptive response and fuher constructive consequences become unlikely, which reinforces the original belief of being useless. In therapy, the latter example could be identified as a self fulfilling prophecy or \"problem cycle\" and the effos of the therapist and client would be directed at working together to change it.",

Each cytokine is encoded by a separate gene, and each pyrogenic cytokine has been shown to cause fever in laboratory animals and in humans. When injected into humans, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF produce fever at low doses (10 to 100 ng\/kg).> Fever, characterized by an elevation of body temperature, usually by 1deg to 4degC, is one of the most prominent manifestations of the acute-phase response, especially when inflammation is caused by infection. Fever is produced in response to substances called pyrogens that act by stimulating prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the vascular and perivascular cells of the hypothalamus. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS; called exogenous pyrogens), stimulate leukocytes to release cytokines such as IL-1 & TNF (called endogenous pyrogens) that increase the levels of cyclooxygenases that convert AA into prostaglandins. In the hypothalamus the PGs, especially PGE2, stimulate the production of neurotransmitters, which function to reset the temperature set point at a higher level.

    "question": "A person present with cribriform plate fracture with CSF rhinorrhea. What will be immediate treatment?",
    "exp": "TREATMENT OF CSF RHINORRHEA Early cases of post-traumatic CSF rhinorrhoea can be managed by conservative measures such as bed rest, elevating the head of the bed, stool softeners, and avoidance of nose blowing, sneezing and straining. Prophylactic antibiotics can be used to prevent meningitis. Acetazolamide decreases CSF formation. These measures can be combined with lumbar drain if indicated. Surgical repair can be done by the following: 1. Neurosurgical intracranial approach. 2. Extradural approaches such as external ethmoidectomy for cribriform plate and ethmoid area, trans-septal sphenoidal approach for sphenoid and osteoplastic flap approach for frontal sinus leak. 3. Transnasal endoscopic approach. With the advent of endoscopic surgery for nose and sinuses, most of the leaks from the anterior cranial fossa and sphenoid sinus can be managed endoscopically with a success rate of 90% with first attempt. Principles of repair include: (a) Defining the sites of bony areas . It can be (i) Cribriform plate (ii) Lateral lamina close to anterior ethmoid aery (iii) Roof of ethmoid (iv) Frontal sinus leak (v) Sphenoid sinus (b) Preparation of graft site. (c) Underlay grafting of the fascia extradurally followed by placement of mucosa (as a free graft or pedicled flap) (d) If bony defect is larger than 2 cm, it is repaired with cailage (from nasal septum or auricular concha) followed by placement of mucosa. (e) Placement of surgicel and gelfoam fuher strengthens the area. This is followed by a high antibiotic smeared nasal pack. Sometimes fat from the thigh or abdomen is used to plug the defect in place of fascia graft. (f) Lumbar drain if CSF pressure is high. (g) Antibiotics CSF leak from frontal sinus often requires osteoplastic flap, operation and obliteration of the sinus with fat. Ref : ENT textbook by Dhingra 6th edition Pgno : 163-165",

Given case repos on liver injuries after ceain antiviral agent treatments, this study examined the effects of lamivudine on alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin (TB) using a medical system database Ref Harrison20th edition pg 2675 Lamivudine has been used for treatment of chronic hepatitis B at a lower dose than for treatment of HIV\/AIDS. It improves the seroconversion of e-antigen positive hepatitis B and also improves histology staging of the liver. Long-term use of lamivudine leads to emergence of a resistant hepatitis B virus (YMDD) mutant. Despite this, lamivudine is still used widely as it is well tolerated Lamivudine, commonly called 3TC, is an antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV\/AIDS. It is also used to treat chronic hepatitis B when other options are not possible.It is effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2.It is typically used in combination with other antiretrovirals such as zidovudine and abacavir. Lamivudine may be included as pa of post-exposure prevention in those who have been potentially exposed to HIV. Lamivudine is taken by mouth as a liquid or tablet HIV, high level resistance is associated with the M184V\/I mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene as repoed by Raymond Schinazi's group at Emory University. GlaxoSmithKline claimed that the M184V mutation reduces \"viral fitness\", because of the finding that continued lamivudine treatment causes the HIV viral load to rebound but at a much lower level, and that withdrawal of lamivudine results in a higher viral load rebound with rapid loss of the M184V mutation; GSK therefore argued that there may be benefit in continuing lamivudine treatment even in the presence of high level resistance, because the resistant virus is \"less fit\". The COLATE study has suggested that there is no benefit to continuing lamivudine treatment in patients with lamivudine resistance. A better explanation of the data is that lamivudine continues to have a paial anti-viral effect even in the presence of the M184V mutation. In hepatitis B, lamivudine resistance was first described in the YMDD (tyrosine-methionine-aspaate-aspaate) locus of the HBV reverse transcriptase gene. The HBV reverse transcriptase gene is 344 amino acids long and occupies codons 349 to 692 on the viral genome. The most commonly encountered resistance mutations are M204V\/I\/S. The change in amino acid sequence from YMDD to YIDD results in a 3.2 fold reduction in the error rate of the reverse transcriptase, which correlates with a significant growth disadvantage of the virus. Other resistance mutations are L80V\/I, V173L and L180M Ref Davidson 23rd edition pg 768",

    "question": "True about keratoconus are all of the following except: September 2005",
    "exp": "Ans. B: It manifests just after bih Keratoconus is frequently due to a congenital weakness of the cornea, though it manifests itself after pubey. However it can occur secondarily following trauma or Down's syndrome. Keratoconus is divided into mild, moderate, and advanced. Mild keratoconus - External and corneal signs are often absent or minimal. - A history of multiple inadequate spectacle corrections of one or both eyes may be noted and may include oblique astigmatism on refraction as well as moderate-to-high myopia. - Irregularly astigmatic keratometry values (egg-shaped), not necessarily on the steep side of normal (approximately 45 diopters (D)), are consistent with diagnosis. Diagnosis can be confirmed with computer-assisted videokeratography, which may reveal corneal inferior steepening (approximately 80% of keratoconus cases), central corneal astigmatic steepening (approximately 15% of keratoconus cases), or even bilateral temporal steepening (extremely rare). Diagnosis may also be aided by applying a diagnostic rigid contact lens with its base curve equal to the flat keratometry value. One observes a typical nipple pattern by use of sodium fluorescein dye in the underlying tear film. Moderate keratoconus One or more corneal signs of keratoconus are often present. Enhanced appearance of the corneal nerves is noted. Approximately 40% of eyes in patients with moderate keratoconus develop Vogt striae (fine-stress lines) in the deep stroma. Approximately 50% develop the deposition of iron in the basal epithelial cells in a (often paial) ring shape at the base of the conical protrusion called the Fleischer ring. Approximately 20% develop corneal scarring. Superficial corneal scarring can be fibular, nebular, or nodular. Deep stromal scarring may occur, perhaps representing resolved mini-hydrops events. Some patients show scarring at the level of the Descemet membrane (posterior limiting lamina), consistent in appearance with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy. Paraxial (usually inferior to the pupil) stromal thinning may be appreciated. Keratometry values typically increase to 45-52 D. Distoion of the retinoscopy and direct ophthalmoscope red pupillary reflex may allow observation of \"scissoring\" or an inferior distoion termed the oil drop sign. The Munson sign is noted when, upon downgaze, a \"V\" shape is noted in the cornea's profile against the lower lid margin, an accentuation of the conical shape of the modest to advanced keratoconus cornea. Advanced keratoconus This often results in keratometry values greater than 52 D and enhancement of all corneal signs, symptoms, and visual loss\/distoion. Vogt striae are seen in approximately 60% of eyes, and Fleischer ring and\/or scarring are seen in approximately 70% of eyes. Acute corneal hydrops can occur. Treatment: In the early stages, vision may be improved with spectacles but contact lens are more beneficial as they eliminate the irregular corneal curvature. If the disease progresses and the cone hydrated, the most satisfactory treatment is corneal transplantation.",

The distal nephron has a negative luminal potential because it is poorly permeable to negatively charged ions. Therefore, when Na+ is reabsorbed, negatively charged ions, primarily Cl-, lag behind, producing a negative intraluminal potential. Although a similar situation occurs in the proximal tubule, the proximal tubule has a higher permeability to Cl- and, therefore, does not develop as large a negative intraluminal potential. The distal nephron is less permeable to hydrogen than the proximal tubule. Aldosterone increases Na+ reabsorption from the distal nephron but has no effect on the proximal tubule. K+ is reabsorbed from the proximal tubule and secreted by the distal nephron.

The goals of treatment are to prevent myocardial ischemia, decrease left ventricular afterload, decrease myocardial oxygen consumption, and prevent rupture and bleeding from suture lines Nitroprusside is a potent direct aerial and venous dilator, acting through release of nitric oxide. It has a rapid onset of action, and a shoer half-life and thus is given in the form of continuous infusion. The hypotensive effects of nitroprusside can be unpredictable because it simultaneously causes potent venodilatation and peripheral aerial vasodilatation. This is especially the case for patients with severe left ventricular hyperophy and preload-dependent diastolic dysfunction. It has been shown to cause coronary steal; it can cause a significant reflex tachycardia, and it can decrease oxygen circulation. It is photosensitive, so it requires special handling. Its most serious adverse effect is in the form of cyanide toxicity, which occurs due to accumulation of its metabolites thiocyanate\/ cyanide and its clinical presentation may vary leading to difficulty in diagnosis.

Lottery method Suppose 10 patients are to be put in a control group or the trial group out of 100 available. The serial numbers of patients are noted on 100 cards and then shuffled well. The cards are drawn one by one and thus patients are allocated into trial and control groups. 2. Table of Random Numbers Published tables of Random numbers are used. This is considered to be the best method of randomization. A computer program is used for randomization o Randomization methods , which may at first seem reasonable (odd-even day randomization or daytime-nighttime convenience randomization), may actually suppo bias, paicularly if the study is open-label or the operator or subject are not blinded as to the nature of the intervention. For example, if the study involves a procedure such as wound irrigation and the patients are randomized to have wounds irrigated with sterile saline on even days and tap water on odd days, a patient may present on an even day and the treating clinical investigator may elect not to enroll the patient in the study or to break the randomization, because they \"just think that this paicular wound needs saline irrigation.\" This is a very common error in otherwise well-designed clinical studies.",

Increased blood flow through pulmonary valve --> Pulmonary ejection systolic murmur and delay & accentuated P2. o Early closure of A2 and delayed closure of P2 cause --> Widely split S2 (But this is usually masked by pansystolic murmur). o Larger volume reaches the left atrium -3 Left atrial hyperophy o Increased blood flow through mitral valve -3 Accentuated Si (But it is masked by pansystolic murmur) and delayed diastolic murmur.

[Ref: Kaplan and Saddock synopsis of Psychiatry 10\/e p 516-5171We are unable to reach a conclusive diagnosis with the information provided in the question.Acute onset, presence of fever, no history of psychiatric illness suggests delirium.But, the diagnosis of delirium cannot be made definitively in the absence of disorientation.In the question there is no definite comment on orientation of the patient.May be, that suggests, the patient is not disoriented.Acute onset, presence of perceptual disturbances (hallucination and other symptoms point towards acute psychosis.But acute psychosis seems unlikely because:-- Absence of cognitive dysfunction or thought disorders.- Absence of H\/o psychiatric illness or substance abuse disorders.Psychotic disorders cannot be diagnosed only in the presence of perceptual disturbances. Some disorder in cognitive dysfunction or thought disorders is also required.May be this is a case of acute transient psychosis- These disorders do not give the classical manifestations of psychotic disorders.- They are characterized by the predominance of perceptual disturbances, and they do not fulfil the criteria of psychotic disorders.Acute and Transient Psychotic disordersA large number of psychiatrists especially from the developing countries like India, repoed that many patients developed an acute psychotic disorder that neither followed the course of schizophrenia nor resembled mood disorders in the clinical picture and usually had a better prognosis than schizophrenia.Acute and transient psychosis as a descriptive entity was recognized only with the advent of 1CD-10 in 1992. Where it is included under psychotic disorder.- The key features that characterize the disorder are an -- acute within (2 weeks) onset in all the cases presence of typical syndrome which are described as rapidly changing variables, polymorphic states and typical schizophrenic symptoms evidence ,for associated acute stress in a substantial number of cases and complete recovery in most cases within 2-3 months.A pa from these criteria ICD-10 also provides diagnostic guide- lines which include- Not meeting the criteria for manic or depressive episodes although the affective symptoms may be prominent - Absence of organic causation although perplexity confusion and inattention may he present. - Absence of obvious intoxication by drugs or alcohol.It is evident that ICD 10 intends to \"clearly differentiate\" the concept of acute transient psychosis .from those of affective psychosis, organic psychosis and drug induced psychosis.This is the point which is creating doubt in our minds.The ICD wants to clearly differentiate it from organic psychosis.- The boy presents with \"fever\" therefore the organic cause for the psychosis cannot be ruled out. - May be the psychosis is due to fever (some C.N.S. infection)- If fever had not been mentioned the diagnosis would have been clear. But the presence of fever prevents us from diagnosing this as acute transient psychosis.- The correct option would have been \"organic psychosis\" or \"psychosis due to general medical condition\". - Acute psychosis cannot be diagnosed without addressing the organic basis of the disease.Four subtypes of acute transient psychosis are described in ICD 10 -Acute polymorphic psychotic disorder without symptoms of schizo- phrenia - Acute polymorphic psychotic disorders with symptoms (?f schizo- phrenia - Acute schizophrenia like psychotic disorder- Acute predominantly delusional psychotic disorderOverall, duration of total episode should not exceed 3 months and that .for schizophrenic symptoms should not exceed 1 month.

Sympathetic stimulation to the efferent glomerular aerioles causes their constriction and increases the filtration rate, leading to an increase in urinary output. Similarly, with the loss of sympathetic innervation, such as due to sympathectomy of the kidney, relaxation of tone of the afferent aeriole occurs and the filtration rate increases, which results in an increased urine output. Decreased urine output may result from the constriction of the afferent aerioles, leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate.

C: Valproate Sodium valproate is effective in absence\/petit-mal seizures, combined grand mal and petit mal, myoclonic epilepsy, paial epilepsy, maniac depressive psychosis and as a prophylactic in febrile convulsion Absence seizures\/Petit mal seizures (from the French for \"little illness\", a term dating from the late 18th century). Absences seizures are brief (usually less than 20 seconds), generalized epileptic seizures of sudden onset and termination. They have 2 essential components: - Clinically the impairment of consciousness (absence) - EEG generalized spike-and-slow wave discharges Absence seizures are broadly divided in typical and atypical absence seizures. Typical absence seizures usually occur in the context of idiopathic generalised epilepsies and EEG shows fast >2.5 Hz generalised spike-wave discharges. Atypical absence seizures: - Occur only in the context of mainly severe symptomatic or cryptogenic epilepsies of children with learning difficulties who also suffer from frequent seizures of other types such as atonic, tonic and myoclonic - Onset and termination is not so abrupt and changes in tone are more pronounced - Ictal EEG is of slow less than 2.5 Hz spike and slow wave. - The discharge is heterogeneous, often asymmetrical and may include irregular spike and slow wave complexes, fast and other paroxysmal activity. - Background interictal EEG is usually abnormal. Treatment of patients with absence seizures only is mainly with sodium valproate or ethosuximide, which are of equal efficacy controlling absences in around 75% of patients. Sodium valproate as a single drug is the DOC if tonic clonic seizures are also present or emerge during the therapy with ethosuximide Lamotrigine monotherapy is less effective with nearly half of the patients becoming seizure free.",

    "question": "All the following features our ventricular tachycardia as the cause of broad-complex tachycardia, except -",
    "exp": "Ventricular tachycardia can be classified based on its morphology: Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia means that the appearance of all the beats match each other in each lead of a surface electrocardiogram (ECG). Scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is the most common type and a frequent cause of death in patients having survived a hea attack, especially if they have weak hea muscle. RVOT tachycardia is a type of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia originating in the right ventricular outflow tract. RVOT morphology refers to the characteristic pattern of this type of tachycardia on an ECG. The source of the re-entry circuit can be identified by evaluating the morphology of the QRS complex in the V1 lead of a surface ECG. If the R wave is dominant (consistent with a right bundle branch block morphology), this indicates the origin of the VT is the left ventricle. Conversely, if the S wave is dominant (consistent with a left bundle branch block morphology, this is consistent with VT originating from the right ventricle or interventricular septum. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, on the other hand, has beat-to-beat variations in morphology. This may appear as a cyclical progressive change in cardiac axis, previously referred to by its French name torsades de pointes (\"twisting of the spikes\"). However, at the current time, the term torsades de pointes is reserved for polymorphic VT occurring in the context of a prolonged resting QT interval. Another way to classify ventricular tachycardias is the duration of the episodes: Three or more beats in a row on an ECG that originate from the ventricle at a rate of more than 120 beats per minute constitute a ventricular tachycardia Ref Harrison 20th edition pg 1423",

Radiation exposure during childhood also increases the risk of benign thyroid nodules and hypothyroidism. The purpose of this topic is to review the evaluation of a patient with a history of childhood radiation exposure and how such a history affects treatment of patients with thyroid tumors. Radiation injury to other organs is reviewed separately. (See and .) RADIATION EXPOSURE Type of exposure -- Radiation exposure may be external or internal. *External - The predominant types of external radiation are diagnostic radiographs, therapeutic radiation for the treatment of cancer, and historical use of external radiation to treat a wide variety of nonmalignant conditions. External radiation also includes brachytherapy, whereby a sealed radiation source is placed adjacent to a treatment area. *Internal - Internal radiation exposure includes ingestion of foods or liquids contaminated with radioactivity or by inhalation of radioactive gases or paicles. Internal radiation occurs after exposure to nuclear fallout (from testing and accidents at operating nuclear power plants or above ground nuclear explosive testing) or after ingestion of radioiodine for diagnostic tests and for therapy of hypehyroidism.",

    "exp": "(c) Source: (Hay et al, pp 1163-1166. Kliegman et al, pp 925-928. McMillan et al, pp 482-483, 501-506. Rudolph et al, pp 1097-1099.) The radiograph shows diffuse that infiltrates bilaterally; this can be seen with neonatal pneumonia or primary surfactant deficiency. The rapid onset of the symptoms, the low WBC count with left shift, and the depicted chest x-ray findings, however, are typical of a patient with group B streptococcus (GBS) pneumonia. Appropriate management would include rapid recognition of symptoms, cardiorespiratory support, and prompt institution of antibiotics. Despite these measures, mortality from this infection is not uncommon. The other infectious causes listed do not present so early, and the noninfectious causes listed do not cause elevations in the band count. GBS disease in the infant is decreasing in incidence with better prevention strategies in the perinatal period; early screening in pregnancy and treatment with antibiotics just prior to delivery to eliminate GBS colonization markedly decreases the risk to the infant. Congenital syphilis can cause pneumonia, but it is diagnosed at birth along with other features including hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, rashes, hemolytic anemia, and others. Diaphragmatic hernia presents with early respiratory distress, but the diagnosis is confirmed clinically with bowel sounds heard in the chest and a radiograph that has loops of bowel located above the normal placement of the diaphragm. Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) causes an increase in respiratory rate and occasionally a low oxygen requirement; the history is often positive for a cesarean delivery, and the radiograph shows retained fluid in the fissures. TTN does not cause temperature instability nor an abnormal CBC. Chlamydial pneumonia is not a condition that occurs in an 8-hour-old infant; it is generally a mild pneumonia that can develop in an exposed infant at several weeks of life.",

There may also be a mediastinal shift away from the side of the hernia.o Historically, the surgical repair of a CDH was considered to be a surgical emergency' because it was believed that the abdominal viscera within the chest prevented the ability to ventilate. More recently with the recognition of the role of pulmnary hypertension and pulmonary hypoplasia and the adverse effects of early operative repair on the pulmonary function has caused a policy of delayed repair.o Thus most pediatric surgeons wait for a variable period (24 to 72 hrs) to allow for stabilization of the infant before doing surgical repair.Congenital diaphragmatic herniao It is the herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity through the diaphragmatic defecto The defect may be:Posterolateral (Bochdalek hernia)Retrosternal (Morgagni hernia)At the esophageal hiatus (hiatal hernia)Adjacent to the hiatus (paresophageal hernia)o Although all these defects are congenital, the term congenital diaphragmatic hernia is generally used for Bochdalek hernia.",

During this stage, large numbers of organisms are sprayed in droplets, and the patient is highly infectious but not very ill. During the \"paroxysmal\" stage, the cough develops its explosive character and the characteristic \"whoop\" upon inhalation. This leads to rapid exhaustion and may be associated with vomiting, cyanosis, and convulsions. The \"whoop\" and major complications occur predominantly in infants; paroxysmal coughing predominates in older children and adults. The white blood count is high (16,000-30,000\/ uL), with an absolute lymphocytosis.

The nucleus takes on a yellowish brown color (brunescent nuclear cataract). This may range from reddish brown to nearly black discoloration of the entire lens (black cataract). Nuclear cataracts develop very slowly. Due to the lenticular myopia, near vision (even without eyeglasses) remains good for a long time.Cortical cataractNuclear cataracts are often associated with changes in the lens cortex. It is interesting to note that patients with cortical cataracts tend to have acquired hyperopia in contrast to patients with nuclear cataracts, who tend to be myopic.# Berlin's edema (commotio retinae) is a condition caused by blunt injury to the eye.

    "question": "The following are attributes of hepatitis B infection except -",
    "exp": "Hepatitis B may cause an acute viral hepatitis; however, acute infection is often asymptomatic, paicularly when acquired at bih. Many individuals with chronic hepatitis B are also asymptomatic. The risk of progression to chronic liver disease depends on the source and timing of infection . Veical transmission from mother to child in the perinatal period is the most common cause of infection worldwide and carries the highest risk of ongoing chronic infection. In this setting, adaptive immune responses to HBV may be absent initially, with apparent immunological tolerance. Several mechanisms contribute towards this: Firstly, the introduction of antigen in the neonatal period is tolerogenic. Secondly, the presentation of such antigen within the liver, as described above, promotes tolerance; this is paicularly evident in the absence of a significant innate or inflammatory response. Finally, very high loads of antigen may lead to so-called 'exhaustion' of cellular immune responses. The state of tolerance is not permanent, however, and may be reversed as a result of therapy, or through spontaneous changes in innate responses, such as interferon alpha (IFN-a) and NK cells, accompanied by host-mediated immunopathology. Chronic hepatitis can lead to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, usually after decades of infection . Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic process that can be divided into five phases ; these are not necessarily sequential, however, and not all patients will go through all phases. It is impoant to remember that the virus is not directly cytotoxic to cells; rather, it is an immune response to viral antigens displayed on infected hepatocytes that initiates liver injury. This explains why there may be very high levels of viral replication but little hepatocellular damage during the 'immune-tolerant' phase. Hepatitis B core antigen Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is not found in the blood, but antibody to it (anti-HBc) appears early in the illness and rapidly reaches a high titre, which subsides gradually but then persists. Anti-HBc is initially of IgM type, with IgG antibody appearing later. Anti-HBc (IgM) can sometimes reveal an acute HBV infection when the HBsAg has disappeared and before anti-HBs has developed Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 874",

    "exp": "Ans. a (Defects in phagolysosome function) (Ref. H - 17th\/pg. Table 61-4)CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS DISEASEChronic Granulomatous Disease presents before the age of 2 and can be transmitted through X-linked or autosomal pattern of inheritance. The defect lies in the inability to generate oxidative burst to kill organisms after being phagocytosed. The neutrophils lack enzyme NADPH oxidase, which plays an important role in production of microbicidal oxygen radicles. In the lab, the diagnosis can be confirmed through Nitro blue Tetrazolium reduction dye test, which will be negative. B cell and T cell functions are normal. Recurrent infections with catalase producing organisms are common. The NBT test is a measure of the respiratory burst in neutrophils and is used to screen for CGD. Neutrophils will reduce the dye NBT, a clear yellow water-soluble compound, to formazan upon stimulation of the respiratory burst. Formazan thus forms precipitates as a dark blue granular substance, which remains trapped in the cytoplasm. Patients with CGD lack a component of the oxidase system, which produces super oxide anion and thus cannot reduce NBT to formazan. Results are interpreted as follows: Normal (positive test) - cells with an orange-red nucleus and blue cytoplasm; Abnormal (negative test) - cells with an orange-red nucleus and colorless cytoplasm.Phagocytic cell deficiency:Leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome (type 1): Defect in LFA-1 integrin proteins on phagocytes. Presents early with recurrent bacterial infections, absent pus formation, and delayed separation of umbilicus.Chediak-Higashi disease:Autosomal recessive. Defect in microtubular function and lysosomal emptying of phagocytic cells. Presents with recurrent pyogenic infections by staphylococci and streptococci, partial albinism, and peripheral neuropathy.Chronic granulomatous disease:Defect in phagocytosis of neutrophils owing to lack of NADPH oxidase activity or similar enzymes.

    "question": "Most sensitive diagnosis test for ectopic pregnancy",
    "exp": "Transvaginal ultrasound Diagnosis of Ectopic pregnancy Pregnancy is definitely diagnosed by demonstrating intrauterine sac. - A normal intrauterine sac appears regular and well defined on ultrasound. So ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed by demonstrating the absence of the intrauterine sac. In a woman in whom ectopic pregnancy is suspected because of pain, bleeding and positive pregnancy test, performance of vaginal sonography is the logical first step. If the sonography demonstrates live intrauterine fetus then ectopic pregnancy is extremely unlikely. Alternatively if the uterus is empty, an ectopic pregnancy can be diagnosed based on the visualization of an adnexal mass separate from the ovaries. 3-hCG hormones also play an impoant role in the diagnosis of pregnancy. fi HCG is a hormone secreted during pregnancy. It is positive in viually 100% of ectopic pregnancies. However, a positive test only confirms pregnancy and does not indicate whether it is intrauterine or extrauterine. In normal pregnancy pHCG should double up every 2 days but in ectopic pregnancy the rate of increase of fl hCG is slow. 13 hCG litres and ultrasound complement one another in detecting ectopic pregnancy and have led to earlier detection. By correlating fl hCG titres with ultrasound .findings an ectopic pregnancy can often be differentiated.from intrauterine pregnancy. An intrauterine sac should be visible by transvaginal ultrasound when the p hCG is approximately 1000 ml p\/m1 and by transabdominal ultrasound approximately 1 week later when the fi hCG is 1800-3600 ?nip\/int. Thus when an empty uterine cavity is seen with a 13 hCG litre above this threshold, the patient is likely to have an ectopic pregnancy. An empty cavity is less of a concern when a fihCG below this threshold is obtained. Serum progesterone measuremen A single measurement of serum progesterone may sometimes clarify the diagnosis when ectopic pregnancy is suspected, but Its accuracy is crude and the customary thresholds are < 5 ng\/m and > 25 'tend. i.e.a value exceeding 25 ng\/m1 excludes ectopic pregnancy with 97.5% sensitivity, value below 5 ng\/ml occur in only .3 percent of normal regnancies. So normal pregnancies can be excluded if the progesterone level is below 5%. Surgical diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy :- Laparoscopy Direct visualization of the ,fallopian tubes and pelvis by diagnostic laparoscopy offers a reliable diagnosis in most cases of suspected ectopic pregnancy and a ready transition to definitive operative therapy. At times, identification of an early unruptured tubal pregnancy may be difficult even if the tube is .fully visualized. Inspite of the low morbidity and quick recovery time, laparoscopy usually is performed when, on the basis of noninvasive test or curettage results, the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is fairly ceain and medical therapy is not planned. In these cases laporoscopy is used both for therapeutic and diagnostic purpose. Laparotomy Open abdominal surgery is preferred when the woman is hemodynamically unstable or when laparoscopy is not feasible. Laparotomy should not be delayed while laparoscopy is performed in a woman with obvious abdominal hemorrhage that required immediate definitive treatment. Culdocentesis Culdocentesis is the transvaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac in order to determine whether free blood is present in the abdomen. This procedure is useful in the diagnosis of intraperitoneal bleeding. This procedure will reveal nonclotting blood if intra-abdominal bleeding has occurred. If culdocentesis is positive, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed immediately. Indeed, some argue that the main purpose of culdocentesis is, not in diagnosis but to better prioritize patients so that those with positive culdocentensis are taken immediately to the operating room. More on imaging procedures used in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy Vaginal sonography There has been much improvement in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy using vaginal sonography. Its use results in earlier and more specific diagnosis of uterine pregnancy than abdominal sonography and it has become the imaging method of choice in early pregnancy.

This section focuses on the general approach to the developmental assessment, including some specific components of such an assessment, but does not review information on specific autism assessment instruments.\nBasis for guideline recommendations about the general developmental assessment\nIn the previous section on the use of autism assessment instruments, the guideline recommendations are based on the panel's interpretation of an extensive and systematic review of the scientific literature. The panel did not attempt to systematically evaluate the research evidence on effectiveness of the general developmental assessment methods discussed in this section as this was considered outside the specific scope of the guideline. Therefore, guideline recommendations in this section are based on the consensus opinion of the panel, using its collective knowledge and experience in assessing children with autism.

Since sperm motility is dependent on the functioning of cilia, infeility frequently accompanies this disorder.

    "question": "A codon codes for a single amino acid. This characteristic is called ?",
    "exp": "Ans. is 'b' i.e., Unambiguous Characteristics of genetic codes Genetic codes have following characteristics ? 1) Universal :- Each codon specifically codes for same amino acid in all species, e.g. UCA codes for serine and CCA codes for proline in all organisms. That means specificity of codon has been conserved from very early stages of evolution. Exception to the universality of genetic coder are found in human mitochondria, where the code :- a UGA codes for tryptophan instead of serving as a stop codon. AUA codes for methionine instead of isoleucine. CUA codes for threonine instead of leucine. LI AGA and AGG serve as stop codon instead of coding for arginine. 2) Unambiguous\/Specific :- A paicular codon always codes for the same amino acid. For example CCU always codes for proline and UGG always codes for tryptophan. 3) Degeneracy\/Redundancy :- A given amino acid may have more than one codon. For example, CCU, CCC, CCA and CCG all four codons code for proline. Therefore, there are 61 codons for 20 amino acids. 4) Stop or termination or nonsense codons:- Three of the 64 possible nucleotide triplets UAA (amber), UAG (Ochre) and UGA (opal) do not code for any amino acid. They are called nonsense codons that normally signal termination of polypeptide chains. Thus, though there are 64 possible triplet codons, only 61 codes for 20 amino acids (as remaining three are non-sense codons). 5) Non overlapping and nonpuntate (Comma less) :- During translation, the code is read sequentially, without spacer bases, from a fixed staing point, as a continuous sequence of bases, taken 3 at a time, e.g. AUGCUA GACUUU is read as AUG\/CUA\/GAC\/UUU without \"ponctation\" (coma) between codons.",

In these circumstances, the hormone may activate a membrane receptor that does not open any ion channel but instead cause an internal change in the muscle fiber, such as release of Ca2+ from intracellular sarcoplasmic reticulum, the Ca2+ then induce contraction (Guyton 11th\/98)IP3-DAG role (to favour as an ansiver)The acetycholine cause smooth muscle contraction by phospholipase C& IP.,, which increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration-Gcrnong 22nd\/83Role of CAMP & CGMP (Guyton 11th\/98)CAMP & CGMP so called second messengers has many effects on smooth muscle, one of which is to change the degree of phosphorylation of several enzyme that indirectly inhibit contraction.\"An increase in CAMP dampens the contraction response of smooth muscle to a given elevation of sarcoplasmic Ca2+-Harper 2 7th\/579",

It is made up of a lateral and anterior tract. The coicospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement. The majority of fibres of the coicospinal tract cross over in the medulla, resulting in muscles being controlled by the opposite side of the brain. The coicospinal tract also contains Betz cells (the largest pyramidal cells), which are not found in any other region of the body.The nerves within the coicospinal tract are involved in movement of muscles of the body. Because of the crossing-over of fibres, muscles are supplied by the side of the brain opposite to that of the muscle.

It may occur as a complication of : ? Acute coalescent mastoiditis CSOM and cholesteatoma Clinical features Hectic Picket-Fence type of fever with rigor. Headache, Progressive anemia and emaciation. Griesinger's sign : - odema over the posterior pa of mastoid due to thrombosis of mastoid emissary veins. Papilloedema Tobey-Ayer test :- Compression of vein on the thrombosed side produces no effect while compression of vein on healthy side produces rapid rise in CSF pressure which will be equal to bilateral compression of jugular veins. Crowe-Beck test :- Pressure on jugular vein of healthy side produces engorgement of retinal veins. Pressure on affected side does not produce such change. Tenderness along jugular vein Imaging studies Contrast-enhanced CT scan can show sinus thrombosis by typical delta-sign. It is a triangular area with rim enhancement, and central low density area is seen in posterior cranial fossa on axial cuts. Delta-sign may also be seen on contrast enhanced MRI.",

    "exp": "Bronchogenic sequestration refers to the presence of a discrete mass of lung tissue without any normal connection to the airway system.\nIntralobar sequestrations are found most frequently in the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe.\nBlood supply to the sequestered area arises not from the pulmonary arteries but from the aorta or its branches.\nExtralobar sequestrations are external to the lung. Found most commonly in infants as abnormal mass lesions, they may be associated with other congenital anomalies.\nIntralobar sequestrations are found within the lung substance and are usually associated with recurrent localized infection or bronchiectasis.",

    "question": "Which of the following is seen in Vitamin D deficiency-",
    "exp": "Vitamin D deficiency leads to impaired intestinal absorption of calcium, resulting in decreased serum total and ionized calcium values. This hypocalcemia results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, a homeostatic response that initially maintains serum calcium levels at the expense of the skeleton. Due to the PTH-induced increase in bone turnover, alkaline phosphatase levels are often increased. In addition to increasing bone resorption, PTH decreases urinary calcium excretion while promoting phosphaturia. This results in hypophosphatemia, which exacerbates the mineralization defect in the skeleton. Reference : page 2466 Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 19th edition",
